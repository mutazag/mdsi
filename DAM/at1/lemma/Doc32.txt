usually precede several organisational process involve deliberation selection preparation this activity occur project happen normally fall outside purview project a somewhat paradoxical aspect project although offer opportunity enhance organizational knowledge rarely happen practice high pressure environment project leave little time formal train informal learn even capture knowledge document to

often hinder organizational politic inertia far large numb project fail vary perception project goal rationale behind although seem obvious project proceed unless stakeholder share understand objective reason surprise many project drift along without many project planner neglect issue invariably come back bite conclusion in conclusion paper grabher state formation operation project essentially rely societal infrastructure build around network locality institution firm relation temporary permanent system matter straightforward substitution regard term interdependence cool project indeed rely bore institution unarguable also keep mind project often subject negative organisational influence slow even kill altogether perhaps early defence project set nearautonomous initiative so
