over last two decade recognize creativity innovation tend thrive organisation employee say decision affect work lead notion postbureaucratic organisation organisation decision make collectively dialogue consensus hierarchy flat although numb workgroup within large organization function way success postbureaucratic organisation generally see utopian academic ideal unlikely work real world that manage organization department workgroup generally uncomfortable employee work autonomously even though may lead generation novel idea product understandable ultimately responsibility manager ensure organisational departmental goal achieve how else timetested command control approach management in response question pose project management often tout mean manage creative innovative effort organisation see article issue pm network example claim seem reasonable project management definition provide mean manage collective goal orient endeavour far many project especially involve new product software development creativeinnovative component in practice though project management tend bureaucratic affair involve plan must follow schedule must adhere regular progress report must make even perhaps many organization see project management mean manage creative work postbureaucratic set implicit view assumption implementation project management process enable manager control direct creative work without adverse sideeffects a article damian hodgson entitle project work legacy bureaucratic control postbureaucratic organisation explore tension contradiction present notion although article write ago i believe idea explore ever relevant today particularly view increase projectisation organisation work carry within hence motivation summarise review paper background set stage to fair many organization recognise light hand rudder need order encourage creativity innovation in organisation project management often see mean achieve but good work practice hodgsons paper aim provide insight question via case study organization projectbased form management implement mean balance requirement creativity control in word in response challenge postbureaucratic form project management put forward many triedandtested package technique able cope discontinuous work expert labour continuous unpredictable change deliver level reliability control traditional bureaucracy in article i explore contradiction tension within department hybrid mode control implement embody bureaucratic postbureaucratic logic in particular i focus upon discursive tactic employ sell rebureaucratization debureaucratization complex employee response initiative i argue tension evident cast significant doubt feasibility seamless integration bureaucracy postbureaucratic organization discursive tactic hodgson mention seemingly reasonable rational argument organization may use sell idea method approach project management consistent ideal postbureaucratic organization a example argument go follow project management routinely use manage new product development project eminently suit manage creative work incidentally isnt quite right see paper review post bureaucracy vs

management also prescibes work do level control result loss autonomy motivation team member whose job work loss motivation negative effect especially project large creative component to counter criticism recent year project management start focus creative aspect project whats need motivate team foster creativity new product development work say etc a hodgson put link project management change management increase project management influence across industry now large professional organization project management include special interest group area diverse healthcare retail medium market hospitality a consequence last decade time particularly rapid expansion project management issue change knowledge management constant innovation emerge central theme popular management discourse so project management offer two seemingly contradictory benefit ability maintain tight control work ability foster innovation creativity project management see essentially bureaucratic system control base principle visibility predictability accountability operationalize adherence formalize procedure constant write report mechanism at time however project management draw upon rhetoric empowerment autonomy selfreliance central in principle project management offer system attempt integrate bureaucratic control form responsible autonomy keep interdisciplinary knowledgeintensive nature much project work team see light perhaps surprise project management view mean manage creative work case study with background do i now move discussion case study in hodgsons word study focus upon telephone bank northern england i refer pseudonym buzzbank in late s buzzbank set major uk bank i call tn bank represent several success story retail bank sector period through reduce overhead extensive use new technology form sophisticate market technique callcentre technology buzzbank expand rapidly term market share turnover develop key component tn banking global operation my interest particular centre buzzbank senior management identification project management prime critical success factor organization development project management expertise throughout organization see key priority maintain performance next decade to extent project team research scarcely cut edge represent highlytrained knowledge worker develop innovative high technology application solution new sector enormously profitable industry hodgson conduct interview observe operation within it department buzzbank period two year during period organization implement strategic plan aim formalize innovation creative work use project management process idea word couple senior it manager bring level discipline bring idea professional structure work highly successful unit structure discipline achieve implement project management process main rationale use sell project management buzzbank it team familiar need ensure predictability repeatability work do whilst ensure innovation creativity impede another justification offer management size organization grow considerably year prior implementation strategic plan mean exist adhoc work culture long successful that size organization necessitate degree formalization ergo bureaucratic procedure put place rationalise senior management natural inevitable consequence growth organization therefore portray senior management it approach next stage evolution immediate benefit metaphor member senior management charge rebureaucratizing organization carry strong sense inevitability a cast opposition change irrational futile stand way natural evolution far manager organization dub employee resistance natural grow pain like adolescent say cast light dissent viewpoint portray natural unavoidable possibly even necessary ultimately without validity another interest aspect hodgson highlight way old practice successful bad one subsume new formal framework for example old world employee give freedom experiment many consider strength weakness in new world however practice see threat consider important capture thing correctly thing become repeatable ala good practice experimentation necessary a manager put if capture thing right less make thing repeatable record improvement require thing do go right doesnt happen rapidlyexpanding gungho environment hodgson note term rapidlyexpanding gungho use negative sense just good cast positive term flexible proactive etc point management frame exist situation term make implementation new procedure seem like logical reasonable next step process tout mean achieve change ie flexible control way so management go great length avoid use term perceive negative example term structure use instead bureaucracy formalization in way management attempt assimilate exist value buzzbank strategic plan so good work heres hodgson say end result impression give senior management organizational change inevitable give rise understandable irrational resistance now effectively complete good organization whole on hand impression hodgson get speak low level employee different however time spend organization tone target much humour good much strong reaction appear throw doubt extent discourse permeate among general employee particularly within it department humour commonplace everyday banter within team team it division buzzbank increase level bureaucratization butt humour particularly low level hierarchy main experience project management report many buzzbank employee intensify bureaucratic surveillance a key example reaction employee managerial jargon use company circular literature intend promote strategic plan typically comment provoke circulation literature strategic plan excerpt document read member staff add ironic comment underline gap document experience life work department hodgson note employee often appear comply new regulation way intend management at time employee appear comply formal requirement new system term fill necessary form report give time complete necessary worklogs even despite relative sophistication senior management rearticulation key discourse compliance part buzzbank employee many case bear hallmark instrumental behaviour accompany insubordinate statement humour range cynical confrontational at time assurance give senior management immediately contravene fictionalize account project activity submit late else procedure observe meticulously detriment deadline constraint emergent organizational order precarious negotiation alienate compliance autonomous disregard bureaucratic demand in short clear gap perception management employee success newly implement process it clear buzzbank manager see project management mean control direct creative innovative work way negative effect employee morale motivation challenge course lie achieve employee buyin management use many creative tactic sell project management staff this include reference natural process evolution consequent grow pain organization experience make pain change natural inevitable necessary interest future gain manipulation terminology make change seem palatable eg use word structure instead formalization bureaucracy coopt terminology postbureaucratic organization literature design promote new structure for example claim project management process enable organization even responsive change ie flexible change management process from employee perspective technique plainly see method sell unsellable negative reaction employee manifest sarcastic humour often minor act insubordination case study thus highlight difficulty use project management mean control work postbureaucratic work environment wrappingup reflection summary hodgson see case study exemplify problem control vs autonomy emerge postbureaucratic organization manager view project management mean address risk inherent postbureaucratic work whereas employee view unnecessary unjustified imposition management look good world hybrid model incorporate good element post bureaucratic model traditional command control approach case study cast doubt whether hybrid possible solely implementation standard project management technique process it expose tension difference perception occur model implement so leave manager be way manage creative work without destroy employee morale motivation look complaint buzzbank employee clear problem arise loss autonomy enjoy prior implementation new process case measure increase autonomy improve situation a couple possibility come mind i discuss early piece this empower employee make decision affect work mean allow freedom decide good approach solve problem within limit specify organisational resource constraint in situation isnt possible use collaborative technique dialogue map achieve employee buyin of course management prepare engage true dialogue will act upon reasonable suggestion make employee key message simple obvious say employee make workrelated decision engage motivate theyll just warm fuzzy notion back research motivation see paper review example yes mean let go rein control extent clear highlight hodgsons work hold rein tightly may cause problem solve whats call degree flexibility use project management process mean open employee input whats work good whats to sum hodgsons case study suggest inflexible project management base approach manage creative work may work good advertise purveyor framework methodology a alternative may worth take step towards utopian ideal postbureaucratic organisation use technique encourage employee input organisational decision
