issue base information system ibis notation invent horst rittel werner kunz early s ibis good know use dialogue map collaborative approach tackle wicked problem ie contentious issue organisation it range application good capture knowledge good example ill much say late post over last five year i write fair bite ibis blog book i coauthor dialogue map expert paul culmsee present post reprise article i write five year ago whence notation practical aspect notation grammar etc good origin advantage limitation my motivation revisit piece revise update original discussion important cover recent development ibis technology open interest possibility area knowledge management to appreciate power ibis good begin understand context notation invent ill therefore start discussion origin notation follow introduction finally ill cover development last odd year focus recent development i mention wicked origin a good place start start ibis first describe paper entitle issue element information system write horst rittel man coin term wicked problem werner kunz july they state intent behind ibis first line abstract paper issuebased information system ibis mean support coordination plan political decision process ibis guide identification structure settle issue raise problemsolving group provide information pertinent discourse rittels preoccupation area public policy plan also context define term wicked problem originally give background surprise rittel kunz foresee ibis type information system mean support work cooperative like governmental administrative agency committee plan group etc confront problem complex order arrive plan decision problem tackle cooperative paradigmdefining example wicked problem from start ibis intend tool facilitate collaborative approach solve good manage wicked problem help develop share perspective a brief introduction ibis ibis notation consist follow three element issuesor question issue debate typically issue frame question line what x x issue interest group for example case group executive x may rapidly change market condition whereas case group it people x age system hard replace ideasor position response question for example idea offer it group may replace say system new typically whole set idea respond issue discussion represent spectrum participant perspective issue argument pro argument con argument issue complete set argument respond idea represent multiplicity viewpoint compendium freeware tool use create ibis map download in compendium ibis element describe represent node show figure issue represent

map see postor example argument visualisation note use ibis map structure write argument call issue map see example paul child example also feature book make appearance book now know ibis work see example action time trace history notation early day present operation early system when rittel kunz write paper three ibistype system operation two government agency us presume university environment quite possibly berkeley rittel work although seem quaint oldfashioned now surprise manual paperbased system effort expense involve computerize system early s prohibitive payoff questionable rittelkunz paper introduce early also offer short description early ibis system operate a initially unstructured problem area topic denote task name trigger phrase urban renewal baltimore war tax reform about topic subtopic discourse develop issue bring dispute different position rittels word idea response assume argument construct defense different position issue settle convince opponent decide formal decision procedure frequently question fact direct expert feed documentation system answer obtain question turn issue through counterplay question argue participant form exert judgment incessantly develop structure picture problem solution it possible separate understand problem phase information solution since every formulation problem also statement potential solution even today forty year late excellent description ibis use facilitate common understand complex problem moreover process reach share understand whether use ibis key way knowledge create within organization to foreshadow point i elaborate late use ibis capture key issue idea argument connection result navigable map knowledge generate discussion fast forward couple decade in paper publish entitle gibis a hypertext tool exploratory policy discussion conklin begeman describe prototype graphical hypertextbased ibistype system call gibis use capture design rationale yes despite title paper capture design rationale policy discussion development gibis represent key step original rittelkunz version ibis recent version implement compendium amongst thing ibis finally paper disk open world new possibility gibis aim offer user ability capture design rationale option discuss include one reject discussion around pro con a platform promote computermediated collaborativedesign work ideally situation participant locate site remote ability store large amount information able navigate intuitive way gibis prototype prove successful enough catalyse development questmap commercially available software tool support ibis in recent conversation jeff conklin mention questmap early windowsbased groupware tool available market win bestofshow award category it interest note contrast questmap long exist compendium singleuser desktop software primary application questmap area sensemaking help group reach collective understand complex situation may otherwise lead tense adversarial condition indeed precisely rittel kunz intend ibis use key advantage offer computerize ibis system map dialogue realtime map represent point raise conversation along logical connection prove big step forward use ibis help group achieve share understand complex issue that say although notable early success realtime use ibis industry environment see paper example accompany widespread adoption technique it worth explore reason briefly tacitness ibis mastery reason lack traction ibistype technique realtime knowledge capture discuss paper shum et al entitle hypermedium support argumentationbased rationale year gibis qoc reason give for acceptance system must offer immediate value person use quote paper no designer expect altruistically enter quality design rationale solely possible benefit possibly unknown person unknown point future unknown task there must immediate value such immediate value obvious novice user ibistype system there effort involve gain fluency use ibisbased software tool it user gain appreciation value tool overcome limitation map design argument paper whiteboards etc while rule ibis simple grasp intellectual effort cognitive overhead use ibis real time involve tease issue idea argument dialogue classify point raise issue idea argument name describe point succinctly relate link point exist map anticipate fit late develop sense conversational pattern expertise skill develop sustain practice surprise beginner find hard use ibis map dialogue indeed use ibis realtime conversation map tacit skill much like ride bike swim master make sense ibis despite difficulty master ibis easy see offer considerable advantage conventional method document discussion indeed rittel kunz good aware their paper contain nice summary advantage i paraphrase ibis bridge gap discussion record discussion minute audiovideo transcription etc ibis sit two act shortterm memory paper thus foreshadow use issuebased system aid organizational project memory many element issue idea argument come discussion contextual meaning different preexist definition that interpretation point make question raise depend circumstance surround discussion what important contextual mean important formal mean ibis capture former clear way example response question what mean x elicit mean x context discussion subsequently capture idea position ill much say towards end article reason use discussion make transparent support oppose evidence state argument discussion time infer glance unlike case write record see post advantage visual documentation prose often time happen commonality issue similar issue may important precise mean to quote paper description subject matter term librarian documentalists sic may little significant similarity issue issue deal previously information use treatment little issue now search technology however search technology still largely base keyword rather context a properly structure contextsearchable ibisbased archive useful conventional documentbased system a ill discuss next section technology now available to sum although ibis offer mean map argument lack ability make map available searchable across organization ibis enterprise it interest note compendium unlike predecessor questmap singleuser desktop tool enable share map across enterprise to sure possible work around limitation workarounds somewhat clunky a recent advance ibis technology address issue rather elegantly seven sigma australian consultancy found paul culmsee chris tomich peter chow develop glyma pronounce glimmer product make ibis available collaboration platform like microsoft sharepoint gamechanger enable share search ibis map across enterprise moreover shall see implication go beyond share search full disclosure a regular reader blog know paul good friend jointly write book paper however time write i commercial association seven sigma my comment base play beta version product paul kind enough give access good discussion i figure ibis glyma figure ibis glyma click see large picture look feel glyma much compendium see fig keystroke shortcut quite similar i trialled glyma week feel overall experience actually bite good compendium for example navigate series map submaps use breadcrumb trail another example document video embed within map need leave map order view tag medium unless course want see high resolution i wont go detail product feature etc since kind information good access source ie product website documentation instead i now focus glyma address longstanding gap knowledge management system revisit problem context in organisation knowledge artefact document audiovisual medium store hierarchical relational structure example folder within directory structure relational database to sure store artefact often tag metadata indicate create experience tell metadata useful problem context artefact create typically capture anyone read document wonder what earth author think write encounter problem miss context context though hard capture critically important understand content knowledge artefact any artefact access without appreciation context create liable misinterpret partially understand capture context enterprise glyma address issue context rather elegantly level enterprise ill illustrate point inspire case study innovative use sharepoint education paul write time ago case study here backstory pauls word early year i meet louis zulli jnr teacher florida part program call centre advance technology we cokeynoting conference come i drone common sharepoint governance mistake majority lous presentation showcase whole bunch sharepoint power solution student write solution impressive we treat example like ios android window phone app leverage sharepoint display teacher assignment school event class time silverlight base application provide virtual tour campus integration sharepoint moodle open source learn platform a academic planner web application allow student plan class submit schedule review track credit class select whether student selection meet graduation requirement all develop year old level quality i know sharepoint consultancy jealous although example highlight louis impressive paul find interest anecdote lou relate dedication persistence student display work quote paul so demo impressive enough actually impress in fact hook slide deck it anecdote lou tell dedication student task go get thing do he speak student work various school break get project complete leverage other various skill strength lous final slide sum talk brilliantly student want make difference give right project incredible thing make project meaningful let serve purpose campus community learn listen if student good way if idea let explore invest success early make sure infrastructure guarantee uptime development farm every situation different harm failure i fail ive find way wont work thomas a edison in brief point highlight fact lous primary role director center create condition make possible student great work commerciallevel quality work turn student suggest lous knowledge build highperforming team definitely worth capture question whats good way short get visit talk experience see forest tree paul recently interview lou intent document lous experience conversation record video glymafied ie video map use ibis see figure figure knowledge capture via glyma figure knowledge capture via glyma click see large picture there point worth note content entire conversation map see conversation glance context particular point ie content node make clarify connection node neighbour move leave node give high level picture move right drill detail of course reader note core ibis capability available compendium ibis tool glyma offer much consider follow relevant document audio visual medium tag specific node provide supplementary material in case video record tag specific node relate point make video click play icon attach node play segment content node discuss really nice feature save user watch whole video play extend game ffwdrew get point interest moreover provide additional context capture map for example attach paper link web page slideshare presentation etc fill background context glyma integrate enterprise content management system design therefore link map video content powerful builtin search content aggregation feature system for example user able enter search intranet home page retrieve traditional content document also story reflection anecdote expert lou another critical aspect intranet integration ability provide map contextual navigation amazon ability sell book people never intend buy example power navigation ability execute kind query outline previous point along contextual information user profile detail previous activity intranet area intranet user browse make possible present recommendation node map may potential interest user such target recommendation may encourage user explore video rich medium content technical aside a interest underthehood feature glyma use implementation hypergraph database store map note database store representation graph map edge connect vertex this database enable store general graph structure what mean glyma extend store kind map mind map concept map argument map whatever node share across map feature develop yet i mention offer excite possibility future to summarise since glyma store datum enterpriseclass database map make available across organization it offer ability tag node pretty much kind medium document audiovideo clip etc tag specific part medium relevant content node snippet video example moreover sophisticate search capability platform enable context aware search specifically search node keyword tag node interest locate also view map appear map inform us context relate node ability display contextual environment piece information make glyma really interest in metaphorical term glyma enable us see forest tree conclude my aim post introduce reader ibis notation trace history origin issue map recent development knowledge management history technique valuable give insight rationale behind creation lead good understand different way use indeed exaggeration say knowledge management application discuss extension rittels original reason invent ibis i like close piece couple observation experience ibis firstly real surprise technique capture write argument conversation despite three distinct element simple grammar yes require think particularly map discussion real time however cognitive overhead good force mapper think whats say instead just write blind thoughtful transcription aim game when do right result map truly reflect understand complex issue secondly although current discussion ibis focus application dialogue map important role play map organizational knowledge map offer powerful mean navigate complex network knowledge within organisation aspirational endgoal effort global knowledge map highlight interconnection different kind knowledge exist within organization to sure map make little sense human eye powerful search capability make navigable to extent feasible direction i foresee ibis become important skill repertoire knowledge management professional
