aim opinion piece writer convince reader particular idea point view reasonable right typically piece weave fact interpretation reason prose wherefrom hard pick essential thread argumentation in early post i show issue map help clarify central argument difficult piece write map fred brook classic article no silver bullet note i use word difficult article time misunderstand misquote particularly hard follow still brook article border academic argument present therein interest relatively small group people within software development community much developer architect arent terribly interest essential difficulty profession just want get job in present post i develop issue map piece potentially wide interest it community nicholas carr article it doesnt matter main point carr article it become utility much like electricity water rail a trend towards commoditisation gain momentum strategic advantage offer inhouse it diminish organisation good serve buy it service compute utility provider maintain it shop although carr make persuasive case gloss key difference it utility see post despite many business it leader take word way thing it therefore important it professional understand carr argument consequence likely affect time soon havent already some preliminary proceed map first complete article available may want read proceed isnt essential 2 discussion assume basic knowledge ibis issuebased information system see post quick tutorial ibis 3 map construct use opensource tool compendium download with preliminary way let get issue map carr article so whats root ie central question carr pose article title piece it doesnt matter possible root question why doesnt it matter but candidate on basis it infrastructural technology why strategic value it diminish example from clear theres fair degree subjectivity every step construct issue map visual representation i construct interpretation carr argument out many possible i choose why doesnt it matter root question why good view whole point piece convince reader it doesnt matter infrastructural technology consequently strategic significance point become clear development issue map progress idea respond question arent immediately obvious isnt unusual ive mention elsewhere point make sequentially express prose in case may read piece entirety figure element respond root question in case hand response root question stand clearly quick browse article it it infrastructural technology map root question response show figure figure issue map stage figure issue map stage move argument carr offer pro con idea a read article reveal con four pro let look con first it i take mean software complex malleable unlike infrastructural technology point mention pass 3 page paper although complex malleable predecessor it hallmark infrastructural technology argument support idea it infrastructural technology evolution it closely mirror infrastructural technology electricity rail although point encompass point make i think merit separate mention analogy quite strike carr make persuasive wellresearched case support point it highly replicable point need elaboration i think it transport mechanism digital information

figure final issue map figure issue map stage map complete im essentially do post before close however id like mention couple general point arise issue map prose piece figure interpretation article i emphasise interpretation may coincide carr intend convey fact probably doesnt highlight important obvious point writer intend convey write may coincide reader interpret even bad different reader may interpret piece differently writer need write awareness potential misunderstand so first point issue map help writer clarify improve quality reason cast prose issue map sketch logical skeleton framework argumentative prose a help highlight weak point argument for example article carr gloss complexity malleability software weak point argument key difference it traditional infrastructural technology thus 2 point issue map help reader visualise weak link argument may obscure rhetoric persuasive write to conclude issue map valuable writer reader writer use issue map improve quality
