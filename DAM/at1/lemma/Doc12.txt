rationale behind decision make remain opaque want understand particular choice make a brief introduction ibis clearly need mean make informal reason behind decision explicit now numb argument visualisation technique available purpose i focus i work issuebased information system ibis i introduce notation briefly that want detail introduction find article entitle whence issuebased information system ibis consist three main element issue question issue need address position idea response question typically set idea respond issue represent spectrum perspective issue argument pro argument support con argument issue complete set argument respond idea represent multiplicity viewpoint good ibis map tool compendium download in compendium ibis element describe represent node show figure issue represent green question node position yellow light bulb pro green sign con red sign compendium support node type part core ibis notation node link way specify ibis grammar i discuss next ibis element ibis grammar summarize simple rule issue raise anew arise issue position argument in word ibis element question in compendium notation question node connect ibis node idea respond question ie compendium light bulb node link question node arrow point idea question depict respond relationship argument associate idea ie compendium node link light bulb node arrow point latter legal link summarize figure figure legal link ibis rule good illustrate example follow link see illustration ibis action see post example ibis map dialogue see post example argument visualisation issue map use ibis case study in talk i illustrate use ibis go couple example detail i describe detail article rather reproduce i provide link original source first example draw dialogue map exercise i datum warehouse project a detail discussion context process map along figure map develop available paper entitle map project dialogue use ibis case study reflection pdf 2 example i describe lighthearted example use ibis nonwork set discuss post what i now bedtime story dialogue map benefit ibis case study serve highlight ibis encourage collective deliberation issue since issue struggle project often element wickedness elicit opinion group dialogue improve chance arrive solution acceptable group whole additional benefit use ibis group set include it add clarity discussion serve simple intuitive discussion summary compare meet minute be common point reference move discussion forward it capture logic decision decision rationale far still ibis disarm disruptive discussion tactic death repetition person bring issue million different way in situation mapper simply point already capture issue ask person want add anything disruptive behaviour become evident participant include offender beauty ibis lie simplicity it easy learn four node simple grammar moreover participant do need learn notation i find people understand whats go within minute just simple pointer mapper another nice feature ibis methodologyneutral whatever methodological persuasion agile something thats boksed use address decision problem project meeting get start good way learn ibis map logic article newspaper magazine even professional journal once familiar syntax grammar graduate oneonone conversation small meeting when use meet first time tell participant simply take note if thing start work good ie map conversation successfully group start interact map use basis reason mean move dialogue forward once get point want map logic conversation of course much ive mention check reference end piece information map dialogue use ibis wrap a post essentially cover talk i give conference i like wrap couple observation comment audience i begin talk line a central myth decision make organisation rational process i think many audience disagree to surprise however almost unanimous agreement point i make uncertainty problem wickedness also seem resonate there great example audience wicked problem it particularly memorable infrastructure project normally think particularly wicked display element wickedness soon start it seem although mainstream management ignore sensemaking aspect profession many practitioner tacit understand make sense ambiguous situation important part work moreover know good do harness collective intelligence group rather enforce process solution
