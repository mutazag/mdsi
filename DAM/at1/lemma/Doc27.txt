change cliché go constant at give time organisation either plan implement change kind perhaps ubiquity rationale result change question deeply in post i describe unintended effect organisational change draw barbara czarniawskas book a theory organize source i also briefly discuss way side effect avoid ill begin word terminology in article plan change also refer reform change institute order achieve specific goal goal reform refer plan effect plan effect intend result change a i discuss although plan effect may eventually achieve change initiative host unforeseen significant consequence this refer unplanned unintended side effect article organise follow ill begin describe positive negative side effect change follow ill discuss side effect come manage advantageous side effect change although term side effect negative connotation side effect change actually advantageous this include question status quo in organisation process structure take grant rarely status quo question organisational change present opportunity pose how good type question challenge way thing do such question unplanned generally occur spontaneously opportunity reflection consequence previous point question status quo cause people reflect thing do good again unintended consequence reform part plan goal also note although opportunity reflection arise often generally ignore time pressure spontaneous invention finally question reflect status quo trigger idea improvement much people agree point indeed good thing encourage however important point people throe plan change seldom time motivation pursue opportunity harmful side effect change negative side effect plan change insidious tend occur result inaction ie take corrective action counter detrimental effect change follow side effect serve illustrate point aim reform become cast stone objective change initiative formulate base understand situation exist particular point time problem time evolve original objective maybecome irrelevant obsolete yet many change initiative objective rarely review adjust mean get confuse end follow previous point change initiative become pointless objective long relevant however common reaction situation continue initiative justify worthwhile end for example benefit say restructure initiative become moot restructure become objective rather benefit suppose flow help save face project declare success restructure complete regardless whether promise benefit realise improvisation spontaneous invention suppress a i discuss length post plan improvisation complementary contradictory aspect organizational work a negative aspect plan change initiative inimical improvisation responsible oversee change tend ignore even suppress improvisation arise see get way achieve objective primary change plan change initiative generally implement program project in fact major project organisation restructuring enterprise system implementation etc aim implement reform kind however although raison detre project achieve plan objective many suffer negative side effect mention in book czarniawska state plan change rarely ever lead plan effect although claim may tad exaggerate significant proportion large project fail suggest less whiff truth in next two section i take brief look plan change fail do origin side effect change much structure process within organisation complex pathdependent history among thing develop way unique organisation often deeply intertwine a result impossible certain consequence change process structure just many variable dependency involve there two relate point flow firstly plan change need good understand legacy history issue change aim fix may create future problem people involve plan initiate execute reform little appreciation issue secondly major change conceive small numb people hold position authority within organisation this folk tendency gloss complexity often fail involve detail knowledge affect process structure consequently plan overlook dependency possible knockon effect arise result negative side effect discuss previous section do czarniawska recommend follow informal rule successful change be will modify objective change path get understand evolve implement lightweight process avoid bureaucratic procedure be open improvisation good advice go exactly use in recently publish book heretic guide good practice paul culmsee i discuss issue legacy lack inclusiveness address firstly suggest apart time cost scope classic iron triangle project decisionmakers good serve consider legacy separate variable project also see post pauls blog point much importantly describe technique use surface hide assumption aspect history bear project may cause problem future secondly discuss work towards create environment diverse group stakeholder air reconcile viewpoint such discussion prerequisite create plan consider many viewpoint variable possible b support stakeholder without implementation bind sideeffects overlook variable andor action nonactions stakeholder support plan of course inclusiveness sound great difficult practice especially large organisation what decisionmakers case answer come slightly different rather obvious direction in illuminate book decisionmaking james march note organisation face messy inconsistent environment give decision make implement low level good chance success make rarefy air boardroom paraphrase statement book since knowledge local condition specialize competency essential readily find decentralize unit control detail policy implementation adaptation general policy local condition good delegate local unit from standpoint general management strategy usually see gain informational motivational advantage use people local involvement cost accentuate problem central coordination control indeed nasty side effect plan change arise overcentralisation coordination control solution devolve control decisionmaking authority level change implement conclusion plan change fail achieve goal planner foresee consequence change even know factor may important determine moreover individual view change lens background bias interest since organisation consist many individual different view manage change essentially wicked problem to sum initiate largescale change keep mind law unintended consequence plan action consequence intend even foresee this consequence manage get good appreciation factor affect process structure change gain understand factor consideration legacy andor via dialogue involve work process structure change simple way achieve delegate decision make implementation authority belong people work coalface organisation
