jack see discussion go nowhere group talk pro con compete approach half hour keep go around circle a mull jack get idea hed play around visual notation call ibis issuebased information system look opportunity use map discussion real time editor note reader unfamiliar ibis may want look post proceed why give try think i cant bad lot decision make wait break conversation dive get i suggestion say theres conversation map tool ive explore i believe may help us reach common understand approach weve discuss it may even help facilitate decision do mind i try pfft im help us get decision say max hed clearly enough jack look around table mary look puzzle nod assent rick seem unenthusiastic didnt voice objection andrew boss herehegoesagain look face jack track record idea jack surprise say okay why go give minute get set say jack he hook computer datum projector within couple minute blank ibis map display onscreen do glance other look screen expression range curiosity mary skepticism max just word im go say ill use notation call ibis issue base information system capture discussion ibis three element issue idea argument ill explain go along okay let get start figure want discussion whats aim ask his start spiel do jack glance colleague max seem tad skeptical rick ever bore andrew mary stare screen no say anything just prompt ask another question mary say id say explore option implement new system find suitable phrase question how implement system x jack glance other they seem agree less didnt disagree mary excellent say i think thats good summary try he draw question node map continue much discussion kind aim resolve issue question our root question what option implement system x mary put how implement system x figure figure so whats next ask max he still look skeptical jack see intrigue not bad think good next step explore idea address resolve issue so idea response question implement system x any suggestion wed engage consultant say max we do inhouse skill implement jack create idea node map begin type okay hire consultant say he look other continue in ibis idea depict light bulb since idea respond question i draw arrow idea root question like figure figure i think option say mary wed need train may take us long wed learn job viable option good say jack youve give us another option way may go implement option ideally node represent single atomic point so ill capture youve say like he type fast draw node fill detail a write say mary say thats clearly new idea implementation option she also partly describe may go train learn technology learn job ive add how question two point describe wed idea respond question he pause look around check every continue but theres also mention shortcoming take long i capture argument idea con depict red minus map he pause briefly look handiwork onscreen ask any question figure figure rick ask be rule govern node connect good question in nutshell idea respond question argument respond idea issue hand generate type node i give link reference web youre interest that may useful everyone say andrew send us sure let move so anyone option ummnot sure work codevelopment suggest rick do mean collaborative development external resource ask jack begin type yes confirm rick figure figure what cost we limit budget say mary good point say jack start type constraint must satisfy potential approach he stop type look other important criterion apply potential approach criterial question hang root node say do make sense everyone figure figure im sure i understand say andrew why criterion separate approach they arent separate theyre level high specific approach apply solution put another way relate root issue how implement system x rather specific solution ah make sense say andrew notation seem pretty powerful it ill happy show feature late let continue discussion now be criterion good must priority feature describe scope document implement end year say andrew always count manager emphasise constraint okay thats two criterion actually must implement priority feature must implement year end say jack add new node no surprise continue three classic project constraint budget scope time figure figure other now engage map look make note etc jack want avoid drive discussion instead suggest move thing forward ask what consider next i cant think approach say mary do anyone suggestion look pro con list approach ive say ill say i think dumsorry good idea it fraught much risk start max no isnt counter mary contrary hire external risky cost blowout much good point say jack note marys point max specific risk mind figure figure time take much long say max weve already capture con doitourselves approach say jack hmm thats true i reword state hard deadline perhaps say may finish allot time something similar thats good point say jack change node read high risk meet deadline map come along nicely now full attention folk room figure figure alright continue con if pro argument support approach thats easy say mary improve knowledge technology good able support maintain system do consultant enable us complete project quick counter max jack add pro pause give group time reflect map figure figure rick mary sit next whisper sideconversation go andrew max write something jack wait mary i idea say rick we take approach combine good world external consultant internal resource actually weve already get separate approach codevelopment havent discuss yet he group attention now codevelopment allow us use consultant expertise really need develop skill yes wed need put think work i think i cant see codevelopment reduce time risk take long consultant say max true say mary good important enable us develop inhouse skill need support maintain application in long run add huge save just last week i read maintenance anywhere percent total system cost so youre say reduce implementation time result small exposure cost blowout ask jack yes say mary jack add pro wait figure figure i still do see reduce time say max it compare option retort mary wait 2 guy say jack what i reword pro read reduce implementation time compare inhouse option reduce cost compare external option he look mary max seem okay type change figure figure jack ask so issue idea argument anyone like add from whats map seem codevelopment good option say andrew he look around see other think rick mary nod max still look doubtful max ask go figure it isnt easy partition work cleanly team different level expertise jack type con figure figure good point say andrew there may way address concern do think help bring consultant daylong engagement workshop codevelopment approach team max nod yes may work say its worth try anyway i reservation codevelopment seem good three approach great say andrew ill get consultant next week help us workshop approach jack type exchange other start gather thing anything else add ask everyone look map no thats i think say mary look good say mike be sure send us copy map figure figure sure ill print copy right away say jack since weve develop together shouldnt point disagreement thats true say andrew another good reason use tool gather paper ask be anything else he look around table alright ill see guy late im get lunch next meet jack look around group help along ibis facilitation theyd overcome difference reach collective decision he think wouldnt work jack thank help discussion ibis seem great way capture discussion do forget send us reference say mary gather note ill right away say jack ill also send information compendium opensource
