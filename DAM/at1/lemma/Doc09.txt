anticipate deal risk important part manage project so much framework methodology devote fair bite attention risk management example pmi framework consider risk management nine knowledge area project management now framework methodology normative us risk manage do say anything risk actually handle project it perhaps much expect project run full machinery formal risk management reasonable expect project manager deal risk little systematic way however project management lore rife story project risk manage inadequately manage see post pertinent case study beg question rational reason manage risk project a paper elmar kutsch mark hall entitle rational choice not apply project risk management information technology project address question post summary review paper background paper begin brief overview risk management prescribe various standard risk management make decision face uncertainty to make right decision project manager need figure risk significant consequently methodology offer technique rank risk base various criterion this technique base many rather strong assumption author summarise follow a unambiguous identification problem risk include cause perfect information relevant variable affect risk a model risk incorporate aforementioned variable a complete list possible approach tackle risk a unambiguous quantitative internally consistent measure outcome approach perfect knowledge consequence approach availability resource successful implementation choose solution presence rational decisionmakers ie folk free cognitive bias example much formal methodology assume selfevidently correct note arent correct see post cognitive bias project metarisks limitation score method risk analysis anyway regardless validity assumption clear achieve require great deal commitment effort money accord author provide hint many project run without formal risk management in word despite existence selfevidently correct process manage project risk evidence suggest project manager feel restrict apply optimal process manage risk for example lyons skitmore investigate factor limit implementation risk management australian construction project similar finding barrier use risk management three hong kong industry find prominent study tummala leung burchett leung dominant factor constrain use project risk management lack time problem justify effort project risk management lack information require quantifyqualify risk estimate author review research literature find factor reduce likelihood risk management apply project base finding suggest follow reason project manager often offer justification rationale manage risk problem hindsight much risk management methodology rely historical datum calculate probability risk eventuation however many manager feel rely datum specific unique project problem ownership risk often think someone elses problem there often reluctance take ownership risk fear blame case risk response fail address risk problem cost justification from premise list clear proper risk management timeconsuming effortladen expensive process many it project run tight budget risk management area thats perceive unnecessary expense lack expertise project manager may unaware risk management technique i find hard believe give practically textbook methodology yammer great length importance manage risk besides pretty weak justification problem anxiety by definition risk management imply consider thing go wrong sometimes inform risk stakeholder may decide go ahead project consequently project manager may limit risk identification effort attempt avoid make stakeholder nervous when justify decision manage risk factor often present barrier problem prevent project manager use risk management a illustration project manager may say i cant talk risk project sponsor freak throw office research method author start exploratory study aim develop understand problem perspective it project manager ie project manager actually experience application risk management project study do facetoface interview base pattern emerge study author develop webbased survey administer wide group project manager exploratory phase involve eighteen project manager whereas indepth survey complete just hundred project manager member pmi risk management special interest group although paper doesnt say i assume project manager ask question reference specific project involve perhaps recent i wont dwell research methodology paper detail result interpretation four eighteen project manager interview exploratory study apply risk management process project reason give interpret author cost justification hindsight anxiety ive italicize word interpret previous sentence i believe response give project manager just easily interpret another way ive present argument reader judge interviewee mention at begin much give think tackle risk it simply happen author conclude rationale manage risk case cost justification chain logic due lack time investment resource manage risk justify to seem read much response from response appear real reason exactly interviewee state think manage risk ie risk overlook another interviewee state it nice differently quite vulnerable term software development drive state never position proactive american say we get update system just release rather tell us week advance something happen we never ahead enough able plan author interpret lack risk management case due problem hindsight ie risk update pose part system anticipate risk management possible to interpretation seem little thin surely project manager understand risk arbitrary update pose from response appear real reason project manager able plan ahead heshe advance warn update seem problem break project management process rather anything risk management hindsight my point uncertainty know high probability regular update something do whilst plan project ive dwell example appear author may occasionally fall trap pigeon hole interviewee response predefine rationale one discuss previous section instead listen actually say of course impression base read paper datum present therein author may good unpublished information support classification interviewee response however case present datum paper reliability 2 survey depend set predefine rationale comprehensive correct author present short discussion 2 phase study they find formal risk management process use 3 case study a author point interest statistic especially consider money stake typical it project in case risk management apply respondent ask provide reason reason give extremely vary author pigeonhole predefine category i present original response interpretation reader judge consider follow reason offer respondent apply risk management we havent get time leave no executive call risk measurement company doesnt see value add additional cycle project upper management think require ignorance thing necessary a initial risk analysis do pm bother follow a single risk identification workshop hold early project arrival reason follow process probably attitude member team interestingly author interpret response attributable cost justification rationale however seem several likely interpretation for example attribute lack knowledge value manage risk whereas sound like simple unfortunately rather common buckpassing conclusion towards end paper author make excellent point rationality decision apply risk management from perspective formal methodoologies decision irrational however rationality lack isnt cut dry heres author say decision it project manager apply project risk management may describe irrational less accept premise project manager choose apply selfevidently correct process optimally reduce impact risk project outcome on hand person focus statistical probability threat impact ignore information truly irrational hence project manager act sensibly example apply project risk management rate utility use project risk management high utility confront stakeholder discomforting information spend money address issue may eventuate matter point people do make decision base prescribe process procedure alone consideration author go say pmi apm claim systematic identification analysis response risk project manager achieve plan project outcome however finding show onethird project effectiveness project risk management virtually nonexistent formal project risk management process apply due problem cost justification now although undeniable many project run risk management whatsoever im sure i agree last statement quote from datum present paper seem likely lack knowledge buckpassing prime reason risk management give short shrift project survey even cost justification offer rationale interviewee quote suggest real reason quite different isnt surprise natural attribute unacceptable cost attribute oversight failure i think may case large numb project risk arent manage however author mention impossible make generalisation base small sample so although incontrovertible significant numb project risk arent manage remain open question
