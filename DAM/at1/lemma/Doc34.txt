meet go go nowhere finally john come say there way i day say it take less week there point contention developer manager now open real work meet begin two start talk realistic delivery date manager let call jack please do tell simple twopage web app do several time i add take week okay let walk detail say john go another half hour jack john argue reasonable timeframe complete request work dialogue rationality action much developer designer indeed doer project team several conversation similar this folk spend fair bite time discuss matter relate project work in discussion aim come share understand issue discussion share commitment future action in remainder post ill take look project discussion somewhat philosophical perspective view understand obstacle open dialogue address when participate discussion want view take seriously consequently present view statement hope other see rational ie base sound premise logical think presume john make claim delivery date unrealistic will present argument convince jack indeed point john judge jack other meet base validity statement john make when jack validity claim contest debate ensue aim get kind agreement philosophy underlie process discourse simply another word debate dialogue describe theory communicative rationality propose german philosopher jurgen habermas basic premise communicative rationality rationality reason tie social interaction dialogue in word exercise reason occur dialogue such communication mutual deliberation result general agreement issue discussion only agreement achieve consensus action need take habermas refer latter communicative action ie action result collective deliberation note just clear i read habermas book discussion base entirely secondary source paper author study habermas detail incidentally wikipedia article topic quite good good worth read validity claim since objective project discussion achieve share understand issue share commitment future action say discussion aim achieve communicative action medium mutual understand achieve speech ie statement speaker make base perception reality other involve dialogue convey perception may may match speaker now statement make discussion implicit explicit validity claim ie express speaker belief something true valid less context dialogue participant disagree speaker essentially contest claim accord theory communicative action every utterance make follow validity claim it make claim objective external reality johns statement deadline impossible refer time objective event delivery work software habermas refer truth claim it say something social reality express something relationship speaker listener relationship typically define social workplace norm example relationship manager employee case john jack johns statement expression disagreement manager of course believe position justify take week deliver software habermas refer rightness claim it express something subjective reality speaker personal viewpoint john believe base experience intutition etc deadline impossible for communication happen jack must work assumption john honest ie john truly believe deadline impossible even though jack may agree habermas refer truthfulness claim validity claim relation rationality nicely sum wikipedia article communicative rationality i quote by earnestly offer speech act another communication speaker claim say true also normatively right honest moreover speaker implicitly offer justify claim challenge justify reason thus speaker challenge offer acceptable reason normative framework imply offer give speech act speech act unacceptable irrational when john say task go take week imply justify statement require three way take week objective take week normative base rightness truly believe take week subjective in dialogue validity claim imply rarely test usually take people say face value do ask justify claim nevertheless assume offer justification ask naturally reason doubt validity say it point discourse begin a wener ulrich put paper in everyday communication validity basis speech often treat unproblematic purpose consist exchange information rather examine validity claim none three validity claim make explicit subject discussion it sufficient partner assume anticipate habermas like say speaker prepare substantiate claim ask time possible participant switch different mode communication several validity claim actually test only validity claim indeed become problematic participant feel compel dispute either speaker sincerity empirical andor normative content statement ordinary communication break discourse begin progress project discussion actually depend breakdown ordinary communication good project decision emerge open deliberation pro con compete approach only do move action condition ideal discourse all sound somewhat idealistic habermas note five prerequisite open debate they inclusion affect party include dialogue autonomy participant able present criticise validity claim independently empathy participant must will listen understand claim make other power neutrality power difference level authority participant affect discussion transparency participant must indulge strategic action ie lie in paper bend flyvbjerg add 6 point group able take long need achieve consensus flyvbjerg call requirement unlimited time from list clear open discourse communicative rationality ideal difficult achieve practice nevertheless always possible improve quality dialogue project behoove us project professional strive towards ideal in next section ill look practical way boundary judgement much time discussion jump straight point without bother explain assumption underpin statement by gloss assumption however leave open misunderstand other mean assess validity statement consequently become difficult empathise us for example john say impossible finish work little week support claim state assumption make bear argument he may assume work addition stuff plate on hand may assume much manager may will reassign stuff someone else unless assumption bring open two continue argue without reach agreement werner ulrich point issue tacit assumption unstated framework essentially define boundary within one claim hold he coin term boundary judgement describe fact norm speaker deem relevant statement a boundary judgement determine context within statement hold also determine range validity statement for example john talk deadline impossible context current work situation situation change may estimate ulrich invent notion boundary critique address point in essence boundary critique way uncover boundary judgement ask right question accord ulrich boundary question probe assumption make various stakeholder he classify boundary question four category this motivation include question why project who how measure benefit project do power include question who key decisionmaker regard scope what resource control decisionmaker what resource control decisionmaker ie relevant environmental factor knowledge include what knowledge need work who ie professional knowledge what key success factor eg stakeholder consensus management support technical soundness etc legitimation include who stakeholder include indirectly affect project how ensure interest stakeholder take account how conflict view project objective reconcile question draw paper ulrich i paraphrase way make sense project environment many question difficult address openly especially relate power legitimation answer often bump organisational politic power point however question ask constraint become evident only happen discourse proceed full knowledge possible isnt before close section ill note technique essentially thing i wont discuss ive already exceed reasonable word count conclusion someone recently mention problem project meeting indeed conversation participant see position rational even consequently stick view even face evidence contrary accord theory communicative rationality however folk arent rational subject position view trial argumentation rationality lie dialogue individual statement position a productive discussion validity claim continually challenge converge optimal decision good rational position emerge collective deliberation in close caveat order complete discussion dialogue project organisation take entire book my discussion merely highlight issue technique i daresay rarely touch upon management text course there many tool technique help improve quality discourse within organisation paul culmsee i discuss book heretic guide good practice
