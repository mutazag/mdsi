uncertainty event last year suggest risk management practice many organisation isnt work a book douglas hubbard entitle failure risk management why break how fix it discuss many commonly use risk management practice flaw need do fix post summary review book interestingly hubbard begin write book good financial crisis begin unfold so although discuss matter pertain risk management finance book much broad scope for instance interest project programportfolio management professional many flaw risk management practice hubbard mention often use project risk management book divide three part first part introduce crisis risk management 2 deal popular risk management practice flaw 3 discuss need do fix my review cover main point section roughly order appear book crisis risk management there several risk management methodology technique use quick search reveal hubbard begin book ask follow simple question do risk management method work would organisation use technique know didnt work what consequence didnt work his contention organisation answer first two question negative to answer 3 question give example crash unite flight crash attribute simultaneous failure three independent redundant hydraulic system happen system locate rear plane debris damage turbine cut line example common mode failure single event cause multiple system fail probability event occur estimate little billion however reason turbine break hadnt inspect properly ie human error probability estimate hadnt consider human oversight way likely oneinbillion hubbard use example make point weak risk management methodology huge consequence follow brief history risk management historical time present hubbard present list common method risk management this expert intuition essentially base gut feel expert audit base expert intuition independent consultant typically involve development checklist also use stratification method see next point simple stratification method risk matrix canonical example stratification method weight score assign score different criterion score usually assign expert intuition follow weight base perceive importance criterion nonprobabilistic financial analysis technique compute financial consequence good bad case scenario calculus preference structure decision analysis technique multiattribute utility theory analytic hierarchy process this technique base expert judgement however case multiple judgement involve technique ensure judgement logically consistent ie contradict principle logic probabilistic model involve build probabilistic model risk event probability base historical datum empirical observation even intuition book essentially build case evaluate risk use probabilistic model provide advice build book also discuss state risk management practice end assess survey carry economist protiviti aon corporation hubbard note survey base largely selfassessments risk management effectiveness place much confidence selfassessments risk subject good know psychological effect cognitive bias tendency base judgement flaw perception dunningkruger effect overconfidence one ability acid test assessment whether use sound quantitative measure many firm survey fail count quantify risk good claim assign weight score qualitative judgement count sound quantitative technique late so good way measure effectiveness risk management hubbard list follow statistic base large sample use depend availability historical datum similar situation hand direct evidence risk management technique actually find problem find otherwise for example audit unearth dubious financial practice component test even isnt able test method endtoend may possible test specific component make method for example method use computer simulation may possible validate simulation apply know situation check completeness organisation need ensure risk management method cover entire spectrum risk else theres danger mitigate risk may increase probability another far hubbard state a risk thats even radar manage a far completeness concern four perspective need take account this internal completeness cover part organisation external completeness cover external entity organisation interact historical completeness involve cover bad case scenario historical datum combinatorial completeness involve consider combination event may occur together may lead commonmode failure discuss early finally hubbard close first section observation good use formal methodology use flaw why because flaw methodology lead incorrect decision make high confidence why break hubbard begin section identify four major player risk management game this actuary this perhaps first modern professional risk manager they use quantitative method manage risk insurance pension industry although method actuary use generally sound profession slow pick new technique far many investment decision insurance company come purview actuary so actuary typically cover entire spectrum organizational risk physicist mathematician many rigorous risk management technique come statistical research do 2 world war hubbard therefore call group war quant notable technique come effort monte carlo method originally propose nick metropolis john neumann stanislaw ulam technique calculate average trajectory neutron fissile material see article nick metropolis firstperson account method develop hubbard believe monte carlo simulation offer sound general technique quantitative risk analysis consequently spend fair page discuss method albeit basic level much late economist risk analyst investment firm often use quantitative technique economics popular technique include modern portfolio theory model option theory blackscholes model problem model often base questionable assumption for example blackscholes model assume rate return stock normally distribute ie value lognormally distribute assumption thats demonstrably incorrect witness event last year another way economics play role risk management behavioural study particular recognition decision regard future event risk stock price subject cognitive bias hubbard suggest role cognitive bias risk management consistently overlook see post entitle cognitive bias metarisks followup point management consultant in hubbards view management consultant standard institute largely responsible many adhoc approach risk management a particular favourite folk adhoc score method involve order risk base subjective criterion score assign risk thus subject cognitive bias even bad tool use score end order risk incorrectly bottom line many risk analysis technique use consultant standard justification follow discussion main player risk arena hubbard discuss confusion associate definition risk there plethora definition risk originate academia hubbard show contradict other downright nonintuitive incorrect in clarify academic professional terminology around risk a example take exception notion risk good thing pmi definition view risk uncertain event condition occur positive negative effect project objective definition contradict common dictionary usage term risk generally include bad stuff hubbards opinion may raise eyebrow hackle project management circle i reckon point in opinion important section book chapter hubbard discuss expert knowledge opinion favour standard methodology flaw popular score method risk matrix bad useless see post limitation score technique cox risk matrix theorem detail discussion point a major problem expert estimate overconfidence to overcome hubbard advocate use calibrate probability assessment quantify analyst ability make estimate calibration assessment involve get analyst answer trivium question elicit confidence interval answer confidence interval check proportion correct answer essentially assess expert ability estimate track often right it find people improve ability make subjective estimate calibration train ie repeat calibration test follow feedback see site probability calibration next hubbard tackle several red herring argument commonly offer reason manage risk use rigorous quantitative method among argument quantitative risk analysis impossible unexpected event predict risk measure accurately hubbard state first objection invalid although event spectacular stockmarket crash may overlook model doesnt prove quantitative risk whole flaw a discuss late book many model go wrong assume gaussian probability distribution fattailed one appropriate of course give limit datum difficult figure distribution right so although hubbards argument correct offer little comfort analyst model event occur a far 2 concern hubbard write another book just business variable even intangible one measure book make persuasive case quantity interest measure difficulty first figure factor affect variable straightforward task it depend among thing availability reliable datum analyst experience etc 2 much depend judgement analyst judgement subject bias although calibration may help reduce certain bias overconfidence mean panacea bias 3 riskrelated measurement generally involve event yet occur consequently measurement base incomplete information to make progress often make additional assumption may justifiable priori hubbard strong advocate quantitative technique monte carlo simulation manage risk however believe often use incorrectly specifically they often use without empirical datum validation ie input result test observation be generally use piecemeal ie use part organisation often manage lowlevel operational risk they frequently focus variable important easy measure rather important hubbard call perverse occurrence measurement inversion he contend analyst often exclude important variable consider uncertain they use inappropriate probability distribution normal distribution bell curve always appropriate for example see post inherent uncertainty project task estimate intuitive discussion form probability distribution project task duration they account correlation variable hubbard contend many analyst simply ignore correlation risk variable ie treat variable independent actually arent almost always lead underestimation risk correlation cause feedback effect common mode failure hubbard dismiss argument rigorous quantitative method monte carlo hard i agree principle behind monte carlo technique arent hard follow i take opportunity plug article entitle a introduction monte carlo simulation project task a far practice concern several commercially available tool automate much mathematical heavylifting i wont recommend search use key phrase monte carlo simulation tool reveal many how fix last part book outline hubbards recommendation improve practice risk management much material present draw previous section book his main suggestion adopt language tool philosophy uncertain system to recommend use calibrate probability express uncertainty hubbard believe person make estimate use model calibrate he offer suggestion people improve ability estimate calibration discuss early web site employ quantitative model technique model risk in particular advocate use monte carlo method model risk he also provide list commercially available pcbased monte carlo tool hubbard make point model force analyst decompose system interest understand relationship component see point develop understand basic rule probability include independent event conditional probability bayes theorem he give example situation rule help analyst extrapolate to i also add important understand idea estimate isnt numb probability distribution ie range number probability attach build validate test model use reality ultimate arbiter model build iteratively test assumption observation far model need incorporate mechanism ie observation just raw observation often hard less model incorporate correlation variable note correlation often always indicative underlie mechanism see post introductory example monte carlo simulation involve correlate variable lobby risk management give appropriate visibility organisation in penultimate chapter book hubbard flesh characteristic trait good risk analyst a mention several time book risk analysis empirical science arise experience so although analytic mathematical model aspect risk important good analyst must empiricist ie believe knowledge risk come observation reality in particular tesing model see good match historical datum track model prediction absolutely critical aspect risk analyst job unfortunately many analyst measure performance risk model hubbard offer excellent suggestion analyst refine improve model via observation finally hubbard emphasise importance create organisationwide approach manage risk ensure organisation tackle important risk first risk management budget spend effective way many tool approach suggest book effective use consistent way across entire organisation in reality though risk management languish way priority senior executive even profess understand importance manage risk rigorous way rarely offer risk manager organisational visibility support need job
