platitude people important asset reflect belief survival evolution organisation depend intellectual cognitive capacity individual comprise however view many good document example action demonstrate lack foresight andor general callousness fate organisation work wonder belief justify even really believe spout platitude indeed case enron worldcom mention just two seem suggest stupidity may fairly prevalent present day organisation point subject brilliant paper andre spicer mat alvesson entitle a stupidity base theory organisation post extensive summary review paper background notion success organization depend intellectual rational capability people seem almost obvious moreover good deal empirical research seem support in open section paper alvesson spicer cite many study appear establish develop knowledge employee hire smart people key success everchanging competitive environment this claim mirror theoretical work organization for example nonaka takeuchis model knowledge conversion acknowledge importance tacit knowledge hold employee although still much debate tacitexplicit knowledge divide model serve perpetuate belief knowledge form another central organisational success there also broad consensus decision make organization though subject bound rationality relate cognitive bias large rational process even decision wholly rational usually attempt depict such behaviour attest importance attach rational think organizationland at end spectrum decision describe good stupid a rick chapman discuss entertain book in search stupidity organization occasionally make decision plain dumb however behaviour seldom remain hide rather obvious negative consequence organisation such story thus end immortalize business school curriculum canonical example functional stupidity notwithstanding remark obvious stupidity another category foolishness perhaps pervasive remain unnoticed unremarked alvesson spicer use term functional stupidity refer organizationally support lack reflexivity substantive reason justitication in word functional stupidity amount refusal use intellectual resource outside narrow safe terrain it reflect blinker approach organisational problem wherein people display unwillingness consider think solution lie outside arbitrary boundary a common example certain topic explicitly tacit deem bound discussion many business usual scenario riddle functional stupidity precisely often hard detect a per definition offer three cognitive element functional stupidity lack reflexivity refer inability unwillingness question claim commonly accept wisdom lack substantive reason refer reason base small set concern spin whole issue a common example sort myopia organisation focus effort achieve certain objective little question objective lack justification happen employee question manager hand provide explanation regard action often consequence power relationship organisation may example dissuade employee stick neck ask question manager may deem bound it note functional stupidity little limitation human cognitive capacity nor anything ignorance carelessness lack think former rectify education andor hire consultant requisite knowledge latter via use standardise procedure checklist it also important note functional stupidity necessarily bad thing for example place certain topic bound organisation avoid discussion potentially controversial topic thus keep conflict uncertainty bay maintain harmony doubt also strengthen exist organisational order turn serve reinforce functional stupidity of course functional stupidity also negative consequence chief prevent organisation find solution issue involve topic arbitrarily deem bound example functional stupidity there many example functional stupidity recent history couple irrational exuberance wake internet boom s lack critical examination complex mathematical model lead financial crisis last decade however look much beyond one work environment find example functional stupidity many come category business usual thats just way thing do around phrase use label practice ritually apply without much think reflection such practice often remain unremarked easy link negative outcome indeed author point managerial practice adopt basis faulty reason accept wisdom complete lack evidence author cite example company adopt hr practice actually detrimental employee organisational wellbeing another common example organisation place high value gather information use meaningful way i discuss information perversity length post entitle unspoken life information organisation i wont rehash alvesson spicer point information perversity consequence high cultural value place information see prerequisite proper decision make however reality often use justify questionable decision simply hide behind fact this example suggest functional stupidity may norm rather exception scary think i suspect may surprise many reader dynamic stupidity alvesson spicer claim functional stupidity common feature organisation to understand pervasive look dynamic stupidity establish factor influence they suggest root cause lie fact organisation attempt shortcircuit critical think call economy persuasion activity corporate culture initiative leadership train team identity build relabel position pretentious title many activity aim influence employee use symbol image rather substance such symbolic manipulation author call aim increase employee sense commitment organisation a put organizational context dominate widespread attempt symbolic manipulation typically involve manager seek shape mould mindset employee a core aspect involve seek create degree good faith conformity limit critical think although effort always successful many employee buy thereby identify organisation make employee uncritical organisation goal mean achieve in word set scene functional stupidity take root flourish stupidity management stupidity selfmanagement author use term stupidity management describe managerial action prevent discourage organisational actor employee stakeholder think some way do include reinforcement positive image organisation get employee identify organisation vision myriad organisational culture initiative aim burnish image corporation this initiative often back organisational structure hierarchy reward system discourage employee raise explore potentially disruptive issue monitor sanction activity may disrupt positive image organisation overt form warning say much often though subtle for example many meeting participant participant know certain issue raise at time discussion debate may short circuited exhortation stop think start such occurrence serve create environment stupidity flourish net effect managerial action encourage stupidity employee start cast aside doubt question behave corporately acceptable way word start perform job unreflective unquestioning way some people may actually internalise value espouse management other may psychologically distance value still act way require net effect stupidity selfmanagement author call employee stop question ask just after doubt fade become accept way work end result familiar situation many us know business usual thats just way thing do around paradox consequence stupidity functional stupidity cause feeling certainty dissonance member organisation suppress critical think result easy acceptance way thing feeling certainty come suppress difficult question comfort moreover toe organisational line likely offer material reward promotion do act reinforce functional stupidity other see stupidity reward may also tempt behave similar fashion that say certain functionally stupid action ignore obvious ethical lapse result serious negative outcome organisation amply illustrate recent past such event prompt formal inquiry level organisation doubt accompany informal soulsearching individual level however also amply illustrate guarantee inquiry selfreflection lead major change behaviour once crisis pass people seem happy revert business usual in end though stark difference rhetoric reality organisation emerge eventually employee see contradiction real organisation ask believe result alienation cynicism organisation objective so although stupidity management may beneficial outcome short run price pay long term nothing come free even stupidity conclusion author main message despite general belief organisation enlist cognitive intellectual capacity member positive way truth organisational behaviour often exhibit wilful ignorance fact andor lack logic author term behaviour functional stupidity functional stupidiy advantage maintain harmony less short term long term consequence negative member organisation learn behaviour become aware certain topic bound broach risk conformance reward advancement material gain whereas dissent meet overt little obvious disciplinary action functional stupidity thus act
