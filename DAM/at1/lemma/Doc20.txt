welcome 2 part introductory series text analysis use r first article access my aim present piece provide practical introduction cluster analysis ill begin background move nut bolt cluster we fair bite cover let get right a common problem analyse large collection document categorize meaningful way easy enough predefine classification scheme know fit collection collection small enough browse manually simply scan document look keyword appropriate category classify document base result much often however classification scheme available collection large need use algorithm classify document automatically base structure content present post practical introduction couple automatic text categorization technique often refer cluster algorithm a wikipedia article cluster tell us cluster analysis cluster task group set object way object group call cluster similar sense another group cluster a may guess result cluster depend rather critically method use group object again quote wikipedia piece cluster analysis specific algorithm general task solve it achieve various algorithm differ significantly notion constitute cluster efficiently find popular notion cluster include group small distance note good use distancebased method among cluster member dense area datum space interval particular statistical distribution ie distribution word within document entire collection bite late notion cluster precisely define reason many cluster algorithm there common denominator group datum object however different researcher employ different cluster model cluster model different algorithm give notion cluster find different algorithm vary significantly property understand cluster model key understand difference various algorithm a upshot always straightforward interpret output cluster algorithm indeed see example discuss with say introduction let move nut bolt cluster preprocess corpus in section i cover step require create r object necessary order cluster it go territory

tm package like dtm documenttermmatrixdocs print summary dtm nonsparse entry sparsity maximal term length weight term frequency tf bring us end preprocess phase next ill briefly explain distancebased algorithm work go actual work cluster a intuitive introduction algorithm a mention introduction basic idea behind document text cluster categorise document group base likeness let take brief look algorithm work magic consider structure dtm very briefly matrix document represent row word column in case corpus document word dtm x matrix mathematically think matrix describe dimensional space word represent coordinate axis document represent point space hard visualise course may help illustrate via twodocument corpus three word total consider follow corpus document a five plus five document b five plus six this two document represent point dimensional space word five plus six three coordinate axes see figure figure document a b point word space figure document a b point word space now document think point space easy enough take next logical step define notion distance two point ie two document in figure distance a b i denote dabis length line connect two point simply sum square difference coordinate two point represent document dab sqrt sqrt generalise dimensional space hand distance two document let call x y coordinate word frequency xxx yyy define straight line distance also call euclidean distance dxy dxy sqrtx yx yx y it note euclidean distance i describe possible way define distance mathematically there many other take far afield discuss see article do put term metric metric context merely distance whats important idea define numerical distance document once grasp easy understand basic idea behind cluster algorithm work group document base distancerelated criterion to sure explanation simplistic gloss complicate detail algorithm nevertheless reasonable approximate explanation go hood i hope purist read agree finally completeness i mention many cluster algorithm distancebased hierarchical cluster first algorithm good look hierarchical cluster a wikipedia article topic tell us strategy hierarchical cluster fall two type agglomerative start document cluster algorithm iteratively merge document cluster close entire corpus form single cluster each merge happen different increase distance divisive start entire set document single cluster at step algorithm split cluster recursively document cluster basically inverse agglomerative strategy algorithm good use hclust agglomerative hierarchical cluster heres simplify description work assign document single member cluster find pair cluster close merge so now cluster little compute distance new cluster old cluster repeat step single cluster contain document good need thing run algorithm firstly need convert dtm standard matrix use dist distance computation function r dtm store standard matrix good also shorten document name display nicely graph use display result hclust name i give document just way long heres relevant code convert dtm matrix be asmatrixdtm write csv file optional writecsvmfiledtmeightlatecsv shorten rownames display purpose rownamesm pastesubstringrownamesmrepnrowm substringrownamesm ncharrownamesmncharrownamesm compute distance document vector have distm next run hclust algorithm offer several option check documentation detail i use popular option call ward method other i suggest experiment give slightly different result make interpretation somewhat tricky i mention cluster much art science finally visualise result dendogram see figure run hierarchical cluster use ward method group hclustdmethodwardd plot dendogram use hang ensure label fall tree plotgroups hang figure dendogram hierarchical cluster corpus figure dendogram hierarchical cluster corpus a word interpret dendrogram hierarchical cluster work way tree figure branch point encounter distance cluster merge occur clearly welldefined cluster large separation many closely space branch point indicate lack dissimilarity ie distance case cluster base figure reveal welldefined cluster first consist three document right end cluster 2 contain document we display cluster graph use recthclust function like cut subtree try recthclustgroups result show figure figure cluster solution figure cluster group figure show group cluster figure cluster solution figure cluster group figure cluster solution figure cluster group ill make just point cluster group seem robust happen large distance cleanly separate distancewise cluster group that say ill leave explore ins out hclust move next algorithm k mean cluster in hierarchical cluster specify numb cluster upfront this determine look dendogram algorithm do work in contrast next algorithm k mean require us define numb cluster upfront numb k name algorithm generate k document cluster way ensure withincluster distance cluster member centroid geometric mean cluster minimise heres simplify description algorithm assign document randomly k bin compute location centroid bin compute distance document centroid assign document bin correspond centroid close stop document move new bin else go step a important limitation k mean method solution find algorithm correspond local rather global minimum figure wikipedia explain difference two nice succinct way a consequence important run algorithm numb time time different start configuration select result give overall low sum withincluster distance document a simple check solution robust run algorithm increase numb initial configuration result change significantly that say procedure guarantee globally optimal solution i reckon thats enough say algorithm let get use relevant function may good guess kmeans a always i urge check documentation understand available option good use default option parameter except nstart set we also plot result use clusplot function cluster library may need install reminder install package via toolsinstall package menu rstudio k mean algorithm cluster start configuration kfit kmeansd nstart plot need library cluster librarycluster clusplotasmatrixd kfitcluster colort shadet label line plot show figure figure principal component plot k figure principal component plot k cluster plot show figure need bite explanation a mention early cluster algorithm work mathematical space whose dimensionality equal numb word corpus case clearly impossible visualize to handle mathematician invent dimensionality reduction technique call principal component analysis reduce numb dimension case way reduce dimension capture much variability cluster possible hence comment two component explain point variability bottom plot figure aside yes i realize figure hard read overly long name i leave fix no excuse know run algorithm plot result k yield figure figure principal component plot k figure principal component plot k figure principal component plot k figure principal component plot k choose k recall k mean algorithm require us specify k upfront a natural question good choice k in truth onesizefitsall answer question heuristic may sometimes help guide choice for completeness ill describe even though much help cluster problem in simplify description k mean algorithm i mention technique attempt minimise sum distance point cluster cluster centroid actually quantity minimise total withincluster sum square wss point mean intuitively may expect quantity maximum k decrease k increase sharply first little sharply k reach optimal value problem reason often happen within cluster sum square never show slow decrease sum wss unfortunately exactly happen case hand i reckon picture may help make clear below r code draw plot sum wss function k k way total numb document kmeans determine optimum numb cluster elbow method look elbow plot sum intracluster distance withinss fn k wss wssi sumkmeansdcentersinstartwithinss plot wss typeb xlabnumber clustersylabwithin group sum square figure show result plot figure wss function k elbow plot plot clearly show k sum wss flatten distinct elbow a result method help fortunately case get sensible answer use common sense rather computation choice cluster seem optimal algorithm yield exactly cluster show clear cluster separation point review dendogram cluster plot k mean now i must acknowledge elephant room i steadfastly ignore thus far odd good youve see already it topic theme two cluster correspond unfortunately question straightforward answer although algorithm suggest cluster group silent topic theme relate moreover see experiment result cluster depend criterion construction dtm see documentation documenttermmatrix option cluster algorithm indeed insofar cluster concern subject matter corpus knowledge good way figure cluster theme serve reinforce yet cluster much art science in case hand article length seem important differentiator cluster find algorithm three article small cluster top long piece corpus additionally three piece relate sensemaking dialogue map there probably factor good none stand significant i mention however fact article length seem play significant role suggest may worth check effect scale distance word count use measure cosine similarity thats topic another post note add dec check article visualize relationship document use network graph detail discussion cosine similarity take home lesson result cluster often hard interpret surprise algorithm interpret mean simply chug mathematical optimisation problem onus analyst figure mean mean anything conclusion bring us end long ramble cluster weve explore two common method hierarchical k mean cluster many other available r i urge explore apart provide detail step cluster i attempt provide intuitive explanation algorithm work i hope i succeed a always feedback welcome finally id like reiterate important point result cluster exercise straightforward interpretation often case cluster analysis fortunately i close optimistic note there text mine technique good job group document base topic theme rather word frequency alone ill discuss next article series until i wish many enjoyable hour explore ins out cluster
