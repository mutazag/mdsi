graph theory area mathematics analysis relationship pair object typically graph consist node point represent object edge line depict relationship object a may imagine graph extremely useful visualize relationship object in post i provide detail introduction network graph use r premier open source tool statistic package calculation excellent gephi software visualization article organise follow i begin define problem spend time develop concept use construct graph follow i datum preparation r finally build network graph use gephi problem in introductory article cluster analysis i provide indepth introduction couple algorithm use categorise document automatically although technique useful provide feel relationship different document collection interest in present piece i show network graph use visualise similaritybased relationship within corpus document similarity there many way quantify similarity document a popular method use notion distance document basic idea simple document many word common close share few word problem distance however skew word count document unusually high word count show outlier even though may similar term word use document corpus for reason use another relate measure similarity suffer problem minute represent document mathematically a i explain article cluster analysis document represent point conceptual space dimensionality equal numb distinct word collection document i revisit build explanation say simple document consist word five plus six represent mathematically dimensional space individual word represent three axis see figure here word coordinate axis dimension now connect point represent document point a figure origin wordspace vector case direct line connect point question origin specifically point a represent coordinate space nice quantitative representation fact word five plus appear document exactly note however weve assume order word matter reasonable assumption case always figure figure a another example consider document b consist two word five plus see fig clearly document share similarity document identical indeed become evident note document point b simply point latex space tell us two coordinate wordsfrequencies common document point a figure figure to sure realistic collection document large numb distinct word wed work high dimensional space nevertheless principle hold every document corpus represent vector consist direct line origin point document correspond cosine similarity now easy see two document identical correspond point in word vector coincide on hand completely dissimilar word common vector right angle what need therefore quantity vary depend whether two document vector dissimilarat right angle similar coincide parallel now heres ultracool thing high school math class know trigonometric ratio exactly property cosine whats even cool cosine angle two vector simply dot product two vector sum product individual element vector divide product length two vector in three dimension express mathematically costheta displaystyle fracx xy yz zsqrtxyzsqrtxyz two vector xyz xyz theta angle two vector see fig upshot cosine angle vector representation two document reasonable measure similarity quantity sometimes refer cosine similarity good take similarity measure rest article adjacency matrix if collection n document calculate similarity every pair document a b previous section give us set n number conveniently represent matrix sometimes call adjacency matrix beware though term many different meaning math literature i use sense specify since every document identical diagonal element matrix this similarity trivial know every document identical good set diagonal element zero another important practical point visualize every relationship go make messy graph there nn edge graph make impossible make sense handful document for reason normal practice choose cutoff value similarity set zero build adjacency matrix use r we now enough background get main point article visualize relationship document first step build adjacency matrix in order build document term matrix dtm collection document process i deal length introductory piece text mine topic model in fact

explain detail i need say finally bring us gephi visualize document similarity use gephi gephi open source java base network analysis visualisation tool before go may want download install while youre may also want download excellent quick start tutorial go ill wait to begin theres little format quirk need deal gephi expect separator csv file semicolon so first step open adjacency matrix create previous section adjacencymatrixcsv text editor replace comma semicolon once youve do fire gephi go file open navigate adjacency matrix store load file if load successfully see feedback panel show figure by default gephi create direct graph ie edge arrow point node another change undirected click okay figure gephi import feedback figure gephi import feedback once do click overview top leave screen you end something like figure figure initial overview load adjacency matrix figure initial overview load adjacency matrix gephi sketch initial network diagram depict relationship document need bite work make look nice informative quickstart tutorial mention early describe various feature use manipulate prettify graph in remainder section i list i find useful gephi offer many do explore theres much i cover introductory post first basic you zoom pan use mouse wheel right button adjust edge thickness use slider next text format option bottom leave main panel recenter graph via magnify glass icon leave display panel just size adjuster toggle node label onoff click grey t symbol bottom leave panel figure show state diagram label add edge thickness adjust note graph may vary appearance figure graph node label adjust edge thickness figure graph node label adjust edge thickness default layout graph ugly hard interpret let work fix to go layout panel leave experiment different layout see after mess around i find fruchtermannreingold force atla option good graph in end i use force atla repulsion strength default attraction strength default i also adjust figure size node label font size graph panel center result show figure figure graph use force atla layout figure graph use force atla layout much good for example now evident document connect table tell us transcript conversation neil preston organisational change it nice colour code edgesnodes size node degree connectivity do via rank panel layout area youve just work in node tab select degree rank parameter degree connectivity node hit apply select prefer colour via small icon just colour slider use colour slider adjust degree connectivity colour transition occur do edge select weight rank parameterthis degree similarity two douments connect edge with bite play around i get graph show screenshot figure figure connectivitybased colour edge node figure connectivitybased colour edge node if want see numerical value ranking hit result list icon bottom leave rank panel you see numerical rank value node edge show figure figure node rank figure node rank see leave figure figure edge rank figure edge rank it easy see figure document similar term cosine rank make sense piece i rant current state enterprise architecture first article ea general togaf framework if quick skim youll see fair bite common finally nice adjust node size reflect connectedness associate document you via gem symbol top right rank panel select appropriate min max size i choose default hit apply node size now reflective connectivity node ie numb document cosine similar vary degree thickness edge reflect degree similarity see figure figure node size reflect connectedness figure node size reflect connectedness now look good enough export to hit preview tab main panel make follow adjustment default setting under node label check show label uncheck proportional size adjust font require size under edge change thickness check rescale weight hit refresh make adjustment you get something like fig figure export preview figure export preview all remain now deed hit export svgpdfpng export diagram my output display figure it clearly show relationship different document node corpus node high connectivity indicate via node size colour purple high green low strength similarity indicate edge thickness figure gephi network graph figure gephi network graph document corpus bring us end journey wrap technique text analysis enable us quantify relationship document document similarity relationship numerical measure good comprehensibility enhance meaningful visualisation indeed although state objective article provide introduction create network graph use gephi r i hope ive succeed secondary aim show document similarity quantify visualise i sincerely hope youve find discussion interest useful many thank read a always feedback greatly appreciate
