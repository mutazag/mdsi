represent single record entity interest customer account column represent attribute entity for example customer table may consist column name street address city postcode telephone numb typically define upfront datum model create it possible add column fact tend messy also update exist row information pertain add attribute a long ask information base exist attribute example give list customer base sydney database analyst use structure query language defacto language relational database get answer a problem arise however ask information base attribute include database a example case give list customer make complaint last twelve month a result many datum modeler include catchall free text column use capture additional information adhoc way a may imagine column often end contain several line even paragraph text near impossible analyse tool available relational database note completeness i add database vendor incorporate text mine capability product indeed many now include r another
