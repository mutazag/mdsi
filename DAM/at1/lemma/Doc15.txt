heres question thats mind why organisation find difficult capture transmit knowledge create project ill attempt answer sort post point solution sort take bite detour along way im often guilty let us first consider knowledge generate project in project environment knowledge typically create response challenge face challenge may project objective case knowledge create embed product service design on hand small part project say limitation technology use case knowledge may correspond workaround discover project team member in either case existence issue challenge precondition creation knowledge project team subset decide issue tackle they incrementally exploration trial error discussion create knowledge bargain in nutshell knowledge create project member go process discovery process may involve entire team first example small subset thereof 2 example programmer may work alone in case though aim understand problem explore potential solution find good thus create new knowledge now perspective project organisational learn project documentation must capture solution process develop typically documentation tend focus former neglect latter akin present solution high school mathematics problem without show intervene step my high school math teacher wouldve award zero effort regardless whether answer right and good reason step lead solution important solution why because step illustrate think process reason behind solution so project documentation ideally documentation provide background constraint viewpoint argument counterarguments go creation project knowledge unfortunately seldom why a answer find farsighted paper entitle design organizational memory preserve intellectual asset knowledge economy publish jeff conklin in paper conklin draw distinction formal informal knowledge term correspond endresult process discuss previous paragraphto quote paper formal knowledge stuff book manual document train course primary work product knowledge worker conklin note organisation routinely capture formal knowledge indeed rely without much success organizational memory on hand informal knowledge knowledge create use process create formal result it include idea fact assumption meaning question decision guess story point view it important work knowledge worker formal knowledge ephemeral transitory a consequence informal knowledge elusive rarely make document dr conklin list two reason organisation include temporary organisation project fail capture informal knowledge this business culture value result process in word reason widespread failure capture informal knowledge western culture come value result output work process far process emphasise thing relationship tool knowledge worker support process knowledge work tool focus capture formal knowledge end result knowledge work rather informal knowledge end result achieve step solution speak key create useful documentation thus lie capture informal knowledge in order elusive form knowledge must first make explicit ie expressible word picture heres notion share understand discuss previous post come play to quote conklins paper element create share understand make informal knowledge explicit mean surface key idea fact assumption meaning question decision guess story point view it mean capture organize informal knowledge everyone access it mean change process knowledge work focus create manage share display group informal think learn share display transparent vehicle make informal knowledge explicit notion share display central technique dialogue map group facilitation technique help diverse group achieve share understand problem dialogue map use visual notation call ibis short issue base information system capture issue idea argument come meet see previous post quick introduction dialogue map crashcourse ibis a far knowledge capture concern i see two distinct use ibis they a conklin suggest ibis map use surface capture informal knowledge realtime generate discussion two people it also use situation person research find solution challenge in case person use ibis capture background approach try pro con ie process solution arrive together formal stuff project organisation capture adequately result document provide complete view knowledge generate project now previous post link i discuss example dialogue map use reallife project challenge good implement near realtime update finance datum mart final issue map construct use map tool call compendium reproduce final map example issue map map capture decision make also option discuss argument option a capture decision along context process rationale behind in word capture formal informal knowledge pertain decision in simple case ibis succeed make informal knowledge explicit project team line understand decision make technical business perspective it worth note compendium map reference external document via reference node though little important argumentation extremely useful documentation here illustration reference external document insert ibis map reference node link external doc link external doc a illustrate feature use link range external document click reference node map image open external document exploit project document operate two level first ibis map depict relationship issue idea argument 2 support document provide detail specific node relationship much informal knowledge pertain issue reside first level ie relationship node knowledge make explicit map to conclude perhaps worth summarise main point post project generate new knowledge process issue idea propose explore trialled typically project documentation capture outcome formal knowledge neglect much context background process discovery informal knowledge ibis map offer possibility capture aspect knowledge result greatly improve project hence organisational memory
