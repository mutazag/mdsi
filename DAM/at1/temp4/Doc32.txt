distinct work form projects ie time bound goal focused activities always around  modern notion project however arose development philosophy came us department defense s he states instead fragmenting prespecifying development military technologies along functional disciplines technologies described relation objectives ie military parameters weapons  pacing concentrated efforts crucial parameters met goals accomplished according grand scheme program win armament race development processes earlier seen separate activities now conceptualized integrated entity called program system project  overwhelming scale projects terms financial scientific resources well ambitious timing created formidable problems coordination control experiments various forms organizational control ultimately lead professionalization role project manager from thereon concepts projects project management taken much enthusiasm optimism business industry  formalization various project management methodologies standards qualifications trade journals  seen culmination process given militaryindustrial origins profession easy see command control philosophy dominates much project management thought practice many early projects paraded textbook examples successful projects operated outside normal organizational oversight they large extent deliberately shielded external influences i believe isolation environment seen good thing project managers problems coordination control become much simpler  manage relationships politics perceived external project  practice may necessary workable classified

organization person whose presence underlines fact project exists achieve specified organizational goals finally deadlines defining aspect projects they serve several functions for example ensure

final deadline culminates termination project also serves connector rest organization it time handoffs documentation team disbanding etc occurs thus enabling results experiences project disperse wider organization projects organisations  characteristics noted highlight dual nature projects  hand noted earlier projects seen semiautonomous temporary organisations also firmly embedded within hosting organisation an effect latter particularly evident consulting software services firms even corporate it shops tend similar projects as grabher notes projects apparently operate milieu recurrent collaboration several project cycles fills pool resources gels latent networks project organising mostly directed towards actual realization potential generated reproduced practice drawing core members successful prior projects serve derivative successor projects such chains repeated cooperation held together cut reputation members gain lose previous collaborations another aspect embeddedness colocation team members within larger organizational milieu  standard benefits colocation well known these savings transactional costs incurred communication supervision staff remote locations etc see post transaction cost view outsourcing colocation improves efficacy communication encouraging facetoface interactions it enables near realtime monitoring health project environment

organizational resources people physical infrastructure obvious ones grabher notes increasing projectisation organizations  attributed perception projectbased management efficient way allocate productive resources flexible manner whether perception correct another matter altogether however less obvious influences organisations exert for example grabher points organizational norms rules provide basis emergence swift trust trust based roles professional ability rather individuals personalities further higher level organizational culture plays role determining project governed managed run these explicit implicit norms stabilising influence projects in addition stabilizing influence hosting organisation projects also offer opportunities build enhance links organisations instance strategic partnerships  effect institution building aimed leveraging strengths participating organisations greater joint benefit in situations participating organisations take role lynchpins trust focused grabher makes point firms institutions comprised firms provide resources make projects possible also host range processes needed organize run projects for  projects usually preceded several organisational processes involving deliberation selection preparation these activities occur project happen normally fall outside purview project a somewhat paradoxical aspect projects although offer opportunity enhancing organizational knowledge rarely happens practice  high pressure environment projects leaves little time formal training informal learning even capture knowledge documents to large extent hosting organisations blame grabher suggests paradox consequence lack organizational redundancy projectbased organizing ill end section observation social dimension projects often neglected projects often hindered organizational politics inertia further large number projects fail varying perceptions project goals rationale behind although seems obvious project proceed unless stakeholders shared understanding objectives reasons surprising many projects drift along without many project planners neglect issue invariably comes back bite conclusions in conclusion paper grabher states  formation operation projects essentially relies societal infrastructure built around networks localities institutions firms relations temporary permanent systems matter straightforward substitution regarded terms interdependence cool projects indeed rely boring institutions  unarguable also kept mind projects often subject negative organisational influences  slow even kill altogether perhaps early defence projects set nearautonomous initiatives so although true projects made possible sustained organisations theyre embedded sometimes hindered organisations to sum line projects depend organisations material human resources also draw sustenance affected social environment culture exists within organisations
