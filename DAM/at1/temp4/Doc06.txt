most approaches project risk management prescribe structured approach managing risks involving steps identification analysis response planning see pmbok guide example implicit approach assumption risks exist can identified via systematic investigation among things leads view possible indeed desirable identify possible risks project manage lifecycle project of course new risks may emerge underlying belief can identified managed using structured approach in short fundamental assumption risks objective existence can therefore identified examination project environment in paper entitled the limits risk management a social construction approach bernd stahl coauthors argue traditional view risk management limited the assumption objectivity leads false sense security it often ignores understates risks may specific certain organisations situations consequently suggest may fruitful view risks social constructs perceptions reality products social interactions stakeholders in post i explore somewhat unusual view risk ill first illustrate general idea risk social construct describe common is project risks can seen social constructs ill end brief look implications project risk management project risks social constructs the first step classical standard risk analysis identify possible events may affect project however principle impossible general method consequently risk managers usually compile lists potential risks based prior experience research literature textbooks brainstorming etc use starting points analysis the point methods adhoc despite claims contrary guarantee comprehensive coverage risks this point made clearly paper lyytinen et al examines four techniques software project risk analysis concludes substantial differences quoting conclusion lyytinen paper  practitioners cautious regard expected miracles risk management approach risk management approaches neither complete riskproof italics their value context managing complex sociotechnical change put high premium shaping management attention learning new organizing schemes help make sense development situations new ways  according stahl conclusions lyytinnen researchers support idea risk s social construct comes result interactions agreements involved project individual perceptions we believe objective concept risk flawed threatens success entire enterprise a concept objective risk raises expectation risks can completely controlled also suggests comprehensive list risks compiled end theoretical work reached managerial practice can take these factors can combine create false sense security will dull managers attention can thereby create even bigger risks we hold risk social construction depending social agreements individual perceptions it must ascribed become real in opinion theres big leap logic paragraph i see expectation risk can completely controlled false sense security creates implies risk construct depends social agreements individual perceptions nevertheless i believe social constructionist view risk useful project risks social dimension ill elaborate point via examples next section is project risk social construct examples most research literature social construction tends hard read devoid examples professional project managers can relate this shame much work casts critical eye implicit assumptions underlie project management practice so instead quoting paraphrasing hardtoread papers ill illustrate common project risks social dimension the risks i consider drawn paper entitled early warning signs it project failure dominant dozen leon kappelman co workers the paper presents top twelve earlystage project risks based analysis data gathered project professionals survey research literature ill discuss four risks kappelmans dominant dozen social origins lack top management support according kappelman et al number one risk is projects the point risk often arises dysfunctional politicking managers as kappelman et al state in many cases it projects get caught enterprise politics fundamental disagreements overall enterprise priorities in cases resources enterprisewide commitment required success lacking middle managers see project important enterprise performance evaluations therefore redirect resources attention activities top management support the point risk often consequence corporate politics much social construct lack stakeholder involvement andor participation the following passage paper highlights socially constructed nature risk if key project stakeholders participate major review meetings signals engaged project therefore project high priority other stakeholders soon begin disengage the project manager finds harder get participation resources necessary project success especially fulltime members project team often project team members get reassigned projects perceived important the point key stakeholders influence organisation can cause project go awry another common situation one stakeholders lose interest project see benefits involved this point wellrecognised traditional risk management highlights importance getting stakeholder buyin the point risk consequence individual perceptions objective reality in words social construct lack documented requirements andor success criteria this risk old classic discussed analysed several wellknown writers as robert glass mentions book facts fallacies software engineering this problem caused fact customers users software solution really sure problem need solved they may think know outset discover project proceeds problem wanted solve simplistic unrealistic something else werent expecting or may really know anything outset simply exploring solutions vague problem know needs solved  regardless causes outcome point ill defined scope means different stakeholders different interpretations whats delivered consequently project objectives become matter interpretation opinion this shows even something basic project objectives actually social constructs depend individual stakeholder perceptions seen light isnt stretch say can many objectives stakeholders communication breakdown among stakeholders this risk perhaps obvious social construct communication lifeblood project also basis professional social relationships built communication becomes important projects environments diverse stakeholders ongoing change norm as kappelman et al state any significant project multiple stakeholders requires ongoing choreography various tasks resources change life project inevitable — business environment competitor strategic tactical moves laws regulations management team staff turnover resource availability cost — name just possibilities if stakeholders communicate work together ongoing basis project team will pulled multiple directions  communication breakdowns can occur variety reasons arise conflicting viewpoints involved as i written post project communication a shared worldview includes common understanding tools terminology culture politics etc enables effective communication within group implications the examples show common project risks social dimension even entirely social constructs the social aspects risk often ignored hard handle much easier follow process deal stakeholders might get upset consequently risks communication breakdown lack management support broached high cost speaking i contend many project risks remain unaddressed the implications social constructionist view risk can summed follows it impossible principle compile authoritative lists possible risks risks studied context particular project environment this includes technical social organizational aspects environment particular emphasis given relationships stakeholders may present barriers honest assessment risks these implications suggest participatory approach involving open deliberation mandatory successful risk management as stahl et al put indeed checklist risks just starting point ongoing debate risk management identify stakeholder risky decisions engage free discourse nature evaluation risks the stakeholder discourse used define responsibilities the stakeholders parties interested process presumably best suited identify risk factors ideally process lead consensus concerning risks similar approaches suggested literature however wish emphasise managers understand risk social construct will complex costly process stakeholder discourses way dealing risk make sense italics summing the mathematical analytical machinery risk management can obscure fact managing risks much art science calling skills dealing people well probabilities organisational politics individual perceptions interactions different stakeholder groups play role creating risks in words risks objective entities social dimension
