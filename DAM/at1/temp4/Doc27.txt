change cliché goes constant at given time organisations either planning implementing changes kind perhaps ubiquity rationale results change questioned deeply in post i describe unintended effects organisational change drawing barbara czarniawskas book a theory organizing sources i also briefly discuss ways side effects  avoided ill begin words terminology in article planned changes also referred reforms changes instituted order achieve specific goals  goals reforms referred planned effects planned effects intended results change as i discuss although planned effects may eventually achieved change initiatives host unforeseen significant consequences these referred unplanned unintended side effects  article organised follows ill begin describing positive negative side effects change following ill discuss side effects come  managed advantageous side effects change although term side effect negative connotation side effects change  actually advantageous these include questioning status quo in organisations processes structures taken granted rarely status quo questioned organisational change presents opportunity pose how  better type questions challenge way things done such questioning unplanned generally occurs spontaneously opportunities reflection  consequence previous point questioning status quo  cause people reflect things  done better again unintended consequence reform part planned goals also noted although opportunities reflection arise often generally ignored time pressures spontaneous inventions finally questioning reflecting status quo  trigger ideas improvement most people agree points indeed good things encouraged however important point people throes planned change seldom time motivation pursue opportunities harmful side effects change  negative side effects planned changes insidious tend occur result inaction ie taking corrective actions counter detrimental effects change  following side effects serve illustrate point  aims reform become cast stone  objectives change initiative formulated based understanding situation exists particular point time problem time evolves original objectives maybecome irrelevant obsolete yet many change initiatives objectives rarely reviewed adjusted  means get confused ends following previous point change initiative becomes pointless objectives longer relevant however common reaction situations continue initiative justifying worthwhile end for example benefits say restructuring initiative become moot restructuring becomes objective rather benefits supposed flow  helps save face project  declared success restructuring completed regardless whether promised benefits realised improvisations spontaneous inventions suppressed as i discussed length post planning improvisation complementary contradictory aspects organizational work a negative aspect planned change initiatives inimical improvisations responsible overseeing change tend ignore even suppress improvisations arise seen getting way achieving objectives primary change planned change initiatives generally implemented programs projects in fact major projects organisations restructurings enterprise system implementations etc aimed implementing reforms kind however although raison detre projects achieve planned objectives many suffer negative side effects mentioned in book czarniawska states planned change rarely ever leads planned effects although claim may tad exaggerated significant proportion large projects fail suggests least whiff truth in next two sections i take brief look planned changes fail  done  origin side effects change most structures processes within organisations complex pathdependent history among things develop ways unique organisation often deeply intertwined as result impossible certain consequences changing processes structures just many variables dependencies involved there two related points flow firstly plan changes need good understanding legacy history issues change aims fix may create future  problem people involved planning initiating executing reforms little appreciation issues secondly major changes conceived small number people hold positions authority within organisations these folks tendency gloss complexities often fail involve detailed knowledge affected processes structures consequently plans overlook dependencies possible knockon effects  arise  results negative side effects discussed previous section  done czarniawska recommends following informal rules successful change be willing modify objectives change path get understanding evolves implement lightweight processes avoid bureaucratic procedures be open improvisations  good advice goes exactly  use in recently published book  heretics guide best practices paul culmsee i discuss issues legacy lack inclusiveness  addressed firstly suggest apart time cost scope classic iron triangle project decisionmakers well served considering legacy separate variable projects also see post pauls blog point more importantly describe techniques  used surface hidden assumptions aspects history bearing project might cause problems future secondly discuss   work towards creating environment diverse group stakeholders  air reconcile viewpoints such discussion prerequisite creating plan considers many viewpoints variables possible b support stakeholders without implementation bound sideeffects overlooked variables andor actions nonactions stakeholders support plan of course inclusiveness sounds great  difficult practice especially large organisations what  decisionmakers cases  answer comes slightly different rather obvious direction in illuminating book decisionmaking james march notes organisations face messy inconsistent environments given decisions made implemented lower levels better chance success made rarefied air boardrooms paraphrasing statement book since knowledge local conditions specialized competencies essential readily found decentralized units control details policy implementation adaptation general policies local conditions best delegated local units from standpoint general management strategy usually seen  gaining informational motivational advantages using people local involvement cost accentuating problems central coordination control indeed nasty side effects planned change arise overcentralisation coordination control  solution devolve control decisionmaking authority level changes implemented conclusion planned change fails achieve goals planners foresee consequences change even know factors may important determining moreover individuals  view changes lens background biases interests since organisations consist many individuals different views managing change essentially wicked problem to sum initiate largescale changes keep mind law unintended consequences planned action  consequences intended even foreseen these consequences  managed getting better appreciation factors affect processes structures changed   gain understanding factors consideration legacy andor via dialogue involving work processes structures changed  simplest way achieve delegating decision making implementation authority belongs people work coalface organisation
