conventional approaches knowledge management projects focus cognitive thoughtrelated mechanical aspects knowledge creation capture there alternate view  considers knowledge created interactions people interactions develop mutually acceptable interpretations theories facts ways suit particular needs that project knowledge socially constructed if true project managers need pay attention environmental social factors influence knowledge construction  position taken paul jackson jane klobas paper entitled building knowledge projects a practical application social constructivism information systems development presents knowledge creation sharing process model based social constructivist theory  article summary review paper a social constructivist view knowledge jackson klobas begin observation engineering disciplines founded belief knowledge  expressed propositions correspond reality independent human perception however alternate view knowledge absolute relative ie depends mental models beliefs used interpret facts objects events a relevant example software product viewed business users software developers  former group may see application terms utility whereas latter may see instance particular technology such perception gaps  also occur within seemingly homogenous groups teams comprised software developers example   happen variety reasons differences experience cultural backgrounds make group social constructivism looks gaps  bridged  authors discussion relies work berger luckmann described gap perceptions different individuals  overcome create socially constructed shared reality  phrase socially constructed implies reality pertains project example created via common understanding issues followed mutual agreement players comprises reality for view strikes particular chord akin stated aims dialogue mapping technique i described several earlier posts see article example relevant projects knowledge information systems development social construct first authors make point information systems development isd projects intensive exercises constructing social reality process data modeling these models informed particular worldview systems designers use particular formal representations in isd projects operational reality new explicitly constructed becomes understood accepted negotiated agreement participants two cultures business it essentially knowledge emerges interaction discussion project proceeds however methodologies used design typically founded engineering approach takes positivist view rather social  as authors suggest perhaps social constructivist paradigm offers insight continuing failure namely happening isd project far complex simple translation description external reality instructions computer it emergence

model i discuss following sections knowledge sharing heuristics to begin surveyed literature knowledge management identify knowledge sharing heuristics ie experiencebased techniques enable knowledge sharing as example heuristics associated externalization process we standard documentation modelling tools make business requirements easy understand stakeholders is staff communicate regularly direct facetoface contact we use prototypes  authors identified heuristics each matched process model according authors matching process simple cases doubt process heuristic attached  suggests model provides natural way organize voluminous complex body research knowledge creation sharing why important well suggests conceptual model illustrated fig  form basis simple means assess knowledge creation sharing capabilities work environments assurance relevant variables covered validating mapping  validity matching checked using twenty historical case studies isd projects  worked follows explanations worked well didnt mapped model process areas using heuristics identified prior step  aim answer question relationship project failure problems respective knowledge processes conversely project success presence positive indicators  case studies authors use wellknown possibly overanalysed failure automated dispatch system london ambulance service  paper succinct summary case study i reproduce  london ambulance service las largest ambulance service world provides accident emergency patient transport services resident population nearly seven million people their isd project intended produce automated system dispatch ambulances emergencies  existing manual system poor cumbersome inefficient relatively unreliable  goal new system provide efficient command control process overcome

negative perceptions outmoded unchallenged work practices from validation authors suggest model provides comprehensive framework explains projects failed that may overstating case whats cause whats effect hard tell especially fact nonetheless model seem able capture many knowledgerelated gaps played role failures further looking heuristics mapped process  might able suggest ways deficiencies addressed for example externalization problem area  might suggest use prototypes encourage face face communication is business personnel surveybased tool encouraged authors created survey tool intended evaluate knowledge creationsharing effectiveness project environments in tool academic terms used model translated everyday language example term externalization translated knowledge sharing see fig translated terms  tool asked project managers evaluate project environments knowledge creation process capability scale based inputs recommend specific improvement strategies capabilities scored low  tool evaluated four project managers used work environment period weeks at end period interviewed responses analysed using content analysis match experiences requirements designed intent tool unfortunately paper provide details tool difficult say much paraphrase authors comments based evaluation authors conclude tool provides a common framework project managers discuss issues pertaining knowledge creation sharing a means identify potential problems might done address field testing  evaluators model tested tool field  tester project manager wanted identify knowledge

tool along ideas  completed survey plan returned researchers use tool revealed following knowledge creationsharing deficiencies project managers environment inadequate personal knowledge ineffective externalization inadequate standardization objectivation strategies suggested tool include an internet portal promote knowledge capture sharing  included discussion forums areas capture discuss best practices etc role playing workshops reveal processes worked practice ie surface tacit knowledge based authors suggest technology  used promote support knowledge sharing standardization just storage interventions make tacit knowledge explicit  helpful as side benefit note survey raised consciousness knowledge creationsharing within team reflections conclusions in opinion value paper lies model survey tool conceptual framework underpins namely idea knowledge depends shaped social environment evolves perhaps example might help clarify means consider organisation decides implement project management best practices described fill popular methodologies  wrong way implement practices wholesale without regard organizational culture norms preexisting practices such approach unlikely lead imposed practices taking root organisation on hand approach picks practices useful tailors organizational needs constraints culture likely meet success  second approach works attempts bridge gap ideal best practice social reality organisation it encourages employees adapt practices ways make sense context organization  invariably involves modifying practices sometimes substantially creating new socially constructed knowledge bargain another interesting point authors make several knowledge sharing heuristics i think number classified unambiguously  processes model  suggests model reasonable view knowledge creationsharing process if  accepts conclusion model indeed provide common framework discussing issues relating knowledge creation project environments further associated heuristics  help identify processes dont work well im unable judge usefulness surveybased tool developed authors provide much detail paper however isnt really issue field project management many tools techniques anyway  key message paper opinion every project unique context techniques used others interpreted applied ways meaningful context particular project  paper excellent counterpoint methodologyoriented practice knowledge management projects required reading methodologists project managers believe things need done  book regardless social organizational context
