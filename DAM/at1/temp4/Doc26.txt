 platitude people important asset reflects belief survival evolution organisations depends intellectual cognitive capacities individuals comprise however view many well documented examples actions demonstrate lack foresight andor general callousness fate organisations work  wonder belief justified even really believed spout platitudes indeed cases enron worldcom mention just two seem suggest stupidity may fairly prevalent present day organisations  point subject brilliant paper andre spicer mats alvesson entitled a stupidity based theory organisations  post extensive summary review paper background  notion success organization depends intellectual rational capabilities people seems almost obvious moreover good deal empirical research seems support in opening section paper alvesson spicer cite many studies appear establish developing knowledge employees hiring smart people key success everchanging competitive environment these claims mirrored theoretical work organizations for example nonaka takeuchis model knowledge conversion acknowledges importance tacit knowledge held employees although still much debate tacitexplicit knowledge divide models serve perpetuate belief knowledge  form another central organisational success there also broad consensus decision making organizations though subject bounded rationality related cognitive biases large rational process even decision wholly rational usually attempt depict such behaviour attests importance attached rational thinking organizationland at end spectrum decisions  described well stupid as rick chapman discusses entertaining book in search stupidity organizations occasionally make decisions plain dumb however behaviour seldom remains hidden rather obvious negative consequences organisation such stories thus end immortalized business school curricula canonical examples functional stupidity notwithstanding remarks obvious stupidity another category foolishness perhaps pervasive remains unnoticed unremarked alvesson spicer use term functional stupidity refer organizationally supported lack reflexivity substantive reasoning justitication in words functional stupidity amounts refusal use intellectual resources outside narrow safe terrain it reflected blinkered approach organisational problems wherein people display unwillingness consider think solutions lie outside arbitrary boundary a common example certain topics explicitly tacitly deemed bounds discussion many business usual scenarios riddled functional stupidity precisely often hard detect as per definition offered three cognitive elements functional stupidity lack reflexivity refers inability unwillingness question claims commonly accepted wisdom lack substantive reasoning  refers reasoning based small set concerns span whole issue a common example sort myopia organisations focus efforts achieving certain objectives little questioning objectives lack justification  happens employees question managers hand provide explanations regarding actions often consequence power relationships organisations  may example dissuade employees sticking necks asking questions managers might deem bounds it noted functional stupidity little limitations human cognitive capacities nor anything ignorance carelessness lack thought  former  rectified education andor hiring consultants requisite knowledge latter via use standardised procedures checklists it also important note functional stupidity necessarily bad thing for example placing certain topics bounds organisations  avoid discussions potentially controversial topics  thus keep conflict uncertainty bay  maintains harmony doubt also strengthens existing organisational order turn serves reinforce functional stupidity of course functional stupidity also negative consequences chief  prevents organisations finding solutions issues involve topics arbitrarily deemed bounds examples functional stupidity there many examples functional stupidity recent history couple irrational exuberance wake internet boom s lack critical examination complex mathematical models lead financial crisis last decade however  look much beyond ones work environment find examples functional stupidity many come category business usual thats just way things done around phrases used label practices ritually applied without much thought reflection such practices often remain unremarked easy link negative outcomes indeed authors point managerial practices adopted basis faulty reasoning accepted wisdom complete lack evidence  authors cite example companies adopting hr practices actually detrimental employee organisational wellbeing another common example organisations place high value gathering information used meaningful way i discussed information perversity length post entitled  unspoken life information organisations i wont rehash alvesson spicer point information perversity consequence high cultural value placed information seen prerequisite proper decision making however reality often used justify questionable decisions simply hide behind facts these examples suggest functional stupidity may norm rather exception  scary thought i suspect may surprising many readers  dynamics stupidity alvesson spicer claim functional stupidity common feature organisations to understand pervasive  look dynamics stupidity established factors influence they suggest root cause lies fact organisations attempt shortcircuit critical thinking call economies persuasion activities corporate culture initiatives leadership training team identity building relabelling positions pretentious titles many activities aimed influencing employees use symbols images rather substance such symbolic manipulation authors calls aimed increasing employees sense commitment organisation as put organizational contexts dominated widespread attempts symbolic manipulation typically involve managers seeking shape mould mindsets employees a core aspect involves seeking create degree good faith conformity limit critical thinking although efforts always successful many employees buy thereby identify organisation  makes employees uncritical organisations goals means  achieved in words sets scene functional stupidity take root flourish stupidity management stupidity selfmanagement  authors use term stupidity management describe managerial actions prevent discourage organisational actors employees stakeholders thinking some ways done include reinforcement positive images organisation getting employees identify organisations vision myriad organisational culture initiatives aimed burnishing image corporation these initiatives often backed organisational structures hierarchies reward systems discourage employees raising exploring potentially disruptive issues  monitoring sanctioning activities might disrupt positive image organisation  overt form warnings say more often though subtle for example many meetings participants participants know certain issues raised at times discussion debate may short circuited exhortations stop thinking start such occurrences serve create environment stupidity flourishes  net effect managerial actions encourage stupidity employees start cast aside doubts questions behave corporately acceptable ways words start perform jobs unreflective unquestioning way some people may actually internalise values espoused management others may psychologically distance values still act ways required  net effect stupidity selfmanagement authors call employees stop questioning asked just after doubts fade becomes accepted way working  end result familiar situation many us know business usual thats just way things done around  paradoxes consequences stupidity functional stupidity  cause feelings certainty dissonance members organisation suppressing critical thinking  result easy acceptance way things  feelings certainty come suppressing difficult questions  comforting moreover toe organisational line likely offered material rewards promotions dont   act reinforce functional stupidity others see stupidity rewarded may also tempted behave similar fashion that said certain functionally stupid actions ignoring obvious ethical lapses  result serious negative outcomes organisation  amply illustrated recent past such events  prompt formal inquiries level organisation doubt accompanied informal soulsearching individual level however also amply illustrated guarantee inquiries selfreflection lead major changes behaviour once crisis passes people seem happy revert business usual in end though stark differences rhetoric reality organisation emerge eventually  employees  see contradictions real organisation  asked believe   result alienation cynicism organisation objectives so although stupidity management may beneficial outcomes short run price paid longer term nothing comes free even stupidity conclusion  authors main message despite general belief organisations enlist cognitive intellectual capacities members positive ways truth organisational behaviour often exhibits wilful ignorance facts andor lack logic  authors term behaviour functional stupidity functional stupidiy advantage maintaining harmony least short term longer term consequences  negative members organisation learn behaviour becoming aware certain topics bounds broach risk conformance rewarded advancement material gain whereas dissent met overt less obvious disciplinary action functional stupidity thus acts barrier  stop members organisation developing potentially interesting perspectives problems organisations face  paper makes interesting valid point pervasiveness wilfully irrational behaviour organisations that said i cant help think authors written tongue firmly planted cheek
