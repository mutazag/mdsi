the fundamental premise behind best practices possible reproduce successes excel imitating at first sight assumption seems obvious uncontroversial however people lived implementation best practice know following prescriptions guarantee success actually anecdotal evidence suggests contrary attempts implementing best practices fail this paradox remains unnoticed managers executives continue commit organisations implementing best practices best dubious value why best practices fail there fair bit research shortcomings best practices one thing tells us simple answer question in post ill discuss issue drawing upon old still relevant paper jonathan wareham han cerrits entitled decontextualising competence can best practice bundled sold note i will cover paper entirety discussion will focus aspects relate question raised i may well say i secondary aim accurately vested interest discussing paper over last months paul culmsee i working book discusses reasons best practices fail proposes practical techniques address shortcomings ill end post brief discussion background content book see post pauls take book but lets look paper first  background on first page paper authors state although concept imitating excellent performers may seem quite banal first glance issue will argue altogether simple deeper consideration accordingly purpose paper explore many fundamental often unquestioned assumptions underlie philosophy application business best practice transfer in illuminating central empirical theoretical problems emerging discipline hope refine expectations technique can yield well contribute theory improvement practice one valuable aspects paper lists implicit assumptions often glossed consultants others sell implement best practice methodologies it turns assumptions valid practical situations renders practices worthless the implicit assumptions according wareham cerrits unstated premises behind best practices include homogeneity organisations most textbooks courses best practices present practices though existence independent organizational context put another way assume organisations essentially clearly isnt case organisations defined differences universal yardstick best practices assume universal definition whats best whats best one best others this assumption clearly false organisations different dare i say unique environments objectives strategies how can universal definition best fit transferability another tacit assumption best practice business practices can transplanted receiving organisations wholesale sure recent years recognized transplants successful recipient organisation undertakes changes necessary transplant work b practice adapted recipient organisation the point successful cases change adaptation great longer resembles original best practice this important point hope hell working best practices adapted extensively it also worth mentioning adaptations will succeed made consultation will affected practices ill say later post alienability stickiness these concepts relate possibility extracting relevant knowledge pertaining best practice source transferring without change recipient alienability refers possibility extracting relevant knowledge source alienability difficult best practice knowledge often tacit therefore difficult codify stickiness refers willingness recipient learn knowledge ability absorb stickiness highlights importance obtaining employee buyin implementing best practices unfortunately best practice implementations gloss issues alienability stickiness validation wareham cerrits contend best practices rarely validated more often recipient organisations simply believe will work based consultants marketing spiel see short piece paul strassman dangers what best mean anyway after listing implicit assumptions wareham cerrits argue conceptual basis defining particular practice best weak their argument hinges observation impossible attribute superior performance firm specific managerial practices why well one perform control experiment see happen practices werent used related somewhat subtle point impossible say certainty whether practices exist within model organisations consequences wellthought managerial action whether merely adaptations changing environments if latter true best practice practices exist model organisations essentially random responses organizational stimuli wareham cerrits also present economic perspective best practice acquisition transfer ill omit isnt direct relevance question best practices fail implications the authors draw following conclusions analysis the definition best practices fraught pitfalls environmental factors significant effect evolution transferability best practices consequently works one organisation may work another so can anything salvaged wareham cerrits think they suggest expanded view best practices includes things using best practices guides learning new technologies new ways working using best practices generate creative insight business processes work practice using best practices guide change following highlevel steps necessarily detailed prescriptions these indeed sensible reasonable statements however much weaker usual hyperboleladen claims accompany best practices discussion cerrits johnson focus practices problems used solve in opinion another key reason best practices fail applied without comprehensive understanding problem intended address ill clarify using example quest improve efficiency organisation might go major restructure all often organisations will think consequences restructuring longterm consequences outsourcing certain functions instance the important point realize comprehensive understanding consequences possible stakeholders management employees involved planning restructure unfortunately bottomup approach rarely taken effort involved wrongheaded perception chaos may ensue management actually talking people metaphorical shop floor so organizations take topdown approach dictating will done little employee involvement organisations focus achieve particular end the end reasons wanting achieve consequences remain unexplored assumed obvious stakeholders to put aphoristically organizations focus the heart matter the key understanding best practices work realise many organizational problems wicked problems ie problems hard define let alone solves see paper comprehensive discussion wicked problems lets look organizational efficiency example what really mean improve organizational efficiency more point can one arrive generally agreed way improve organizational efficiency by generally agreed i mean measure stakeholders understand agree note efficiency just example holds matters strategic importance organizations organisational strategy wicked problem since wicked problems hard pin mean different things different people first step solving ensure stakeholders common shared understanding problem the next step achieve shared commitment solving problem any technique help achieve shared understanding wicked problems commitment solving truly deserve called one best practice rule the genesis collaboration about year ago series landmark posts entitled the one best practice rule them all paul culmsee wrote search practical method manage wicked problems in articles made convincing case dialogue mapping can help diverse group stakeholders achieve shared understanding problems pauls writings inspired learn dialogue mapping use work i impressed finally technique didnt claim best practice potential address really complex problems organisations face since paul i several conversations failure best practices tackling issues ranging organizational change project management paul one rare practitioners excellent grounding theory practice i learnt lot conversations among things told experiences using dialogue mapping tackle apparently intractable problems see case study pauls company example late last year thought writing things wed talking series joint blog posts soon realised much say fit series posts probably enough book were months writing book quite pleased way turning heres brief summary book the first part analyses best practices fail our analysis touches upon diverse areas like organizational rhetoric cognitive bias memetics scientific management topics paul i written blogs the second part book presents series case studies illustrate techniques address complex problems organizations face the case studies based experiences using dialogue mapping techniques tackle wicked problems relating organizational strategy project management the techniques discuss go beyond rhetoric best practices work use bottomup approach takes account context environment problems live now paul writes way better i for one writing laughoutloud funny mine isnt those read work mine may wondering different styles will combine im delighted report book way conversational entertaining blog posts however i also emphasise trying rigorous can backing claims references research papers andor case studies were learning lot process writing enthused excited book please stay tuned well post occasional updates progressing
