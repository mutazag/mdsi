ive written number articles project failure covering topics ranging definitions success role biases project failure as interesting issues somewhat removed daytoday concerns project manager interested avoiding failure defining analyzing in paper entitled early warning signs it project failure dominant dozen leon kappelman et al outline top twelve risks associated it project failures  post summarises paper lists top twelve signs impending trouble projects background research methodology  authors focus early warning signs ie occur within initial planned schedule further ensure comprehensive coverage risks conclusions based inputs academic industry journals well experienced it project managers  paper provides detailed explanation research methodology ill quote directly paper  research team first searched literature extensively develop preliminary list early warning signs ewss  two authors experienced it project management added several ewss based personal experience next it project management experts asked assess list on basis feedback added new items modified others develop list ewss finally research team invited experienced it project managers including original experts participate rating ewss using scale extremely unimportant extremely important fiftyfive managers completed survey yielding response rate nearly percent  respondents average years it project management experience  budgets largest it projects managed ranged million billion dollars about percent held title program project manager nearly percent consultant titles director program analyst titles accounted percent percent vice presidents rest held titles ceo cio chief scientist chief technologist partner although list rankings based subjective opinions experts large number participants ensures degree consensus regarding important factors  troublesome twelve after ranking fifty odd risks authors focused scores maximum possible discussed there risks satisfied somewhat arbitrary criterion some similar combined for example four risks no documented milestone deliverables due dates no project status progress process schedule deadline reconciled project schedule early project delays ignored — revision overall project schedule combined ineffective schedule planning andor management  process combining top items resulted twelve risks half turned peoplerelated half processrelated i discuss risks detail peoplerelated early warning signs lack top management support  number  risk fifty three authors listed  isnt surprising project lacks executive support unlikely get financial material human resources necessary make happen ineffective project manager project managers lack communication managerial skills needed move project ahead pose serious risk projects  authors point common risk it projects project managers often technical folks promoted managers as may lack interest aptitude andor skills manage projects interestingly authors comment converse problem whether project managers lack technicaldomain knowledge contributes project failure no stakeholder involvement andor participation a large number projects proceed minimal involvement key stakeholders such folks often lose interest projects immediate matters consume attention in situations project manager may find hard get resources needs get project done stakeholder sponsor apathy obvious warning sign project headed trouble uncommitted project team  commitment preferably fulltime team essential success project management needs ensure team members given time incentives work project a point often left unconsidered intrinsic motivation team see post detailed discussion motivation project management lack technical knowledgeskills project teams need technical skills knowledge relevant project managers sometimes wrongly assume project staff  pick required skills whilst working project another common management misconception project personnel  master new technologies solely attending training courses getting contractors work  solution problem however best option give team enough time get familiar technology prior project failing switch technology team familiar subject matter experts available it often assumed subject matter experts  provide adequate inputs projects whilst regular jobs  seldom works theres choice project jobs latter always wins project sponsors need ensure subject matter experts freed work project processrelated early warning signs unclear scope  authors label  lack documented requirements andor success criteria however i think better described phrase ive used all project management methodologies emphasise importance clear welldocumented requirements success criteria good reason lack clarity regarding project scope means  knows project headed sure sign trouble ahead no change control process as cliché reminds us change constant business environments it therefore inevitable project scope  change changes scope however minor may seem need assessed impact project  effect several small unanalyzed scope changes project schedule underestimated many project managers hard time pushing back scope changes foisted senior executives hence important change control process applies across board everyone regardless authority ineffective scheduling schedule management many schedules built little guesswork unhealthy dose optimism often drawn without input folks wholl actually work see article estimation errors schedules need rooted reality for happen must based reliable estimates preferably responsible creating deliverables once schedule created project managers responsibility update continually reflecting detours roadbumps occurred along way a common failing time overruns properly recorded leading false illusion progress communication breakdown project communication art getting people page reading different books in post obstacles project communication i discussed generic difficulties posed differences stakeholder backgrounds worldviews  key responsibilities project manager ensure everyone project shared understanding project goals shared commitment achieving  true middle end project start resources assigned another project in experience resources rarely reassigned wholesale projects what usually happens reassigned part time basis well take matts time nicks time  problem matt nick  end spending time project leaving  hand bereft no business case a uncommon refrain corporate hallways why project no project given goahead without wellarticulated business case further still since understanding reasons project central success made available every stakeholder shared understanding goals project prerequisite shared understanding rationale behind im sure arent surprises list project managers agree indeed common often ignored early warning signs failure however i suspect  substantial differences opinion regarding ranking wisely authors refrained attempting rank risks list order importance conclusion good projects managers anticipate potential problems take action avoid although risks listed indeed obvious often ignored affected projects limp oblivion responsible failed react portents trouble granted  hard see problems within system particularly system highpressure project thats lists useful  warn project manager potential trouble ahead
