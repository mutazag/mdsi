any futuredirected activity degree uncertainty uncertainty implies risk bad stuff happens anticipated events dont unfold planned unanticipated events occur  main function risk management deal negative aspect uncertainty  events last years suggest risk management practiced many organisations isnt working a book douglas hubbard entitled  failure risk management why broken how fix it discusses many commonly used risk management practices flawed needs done fix  post summary review book interestingly hubbard began writing book well financial crisis began unfold so although discusses matters pertaining risk management finance book much broader scope for instance  interest project programportfolio management professionals many flawed risk management practices hubbard mentions often used project risk management  book divided three parts first part introduces crisis risk management second deals popular risk management practices flawed third discusses needs done fix my review covers main points section roughly order appear book  crisis risk management there several risk management methodologies techniques use quick search  reveal hubbard begins book asking following simple questions do risk management methods work would organisation uses techniques know didnt work what consequences didnt work his contention organisations answers first two questions negative to answer third question gives example crash united flight  crash attributed simultaneous failure three independent redundant hydraulic systems  happened systems located rear plane debris damaged turbine cut lines  example common mode failure single event causing multiple systems fail  probability event occurring estimated less  billion however reason turbine broke hadnt inspected properly ie human error  probability estimate hadnt considered human oversight way likely oneinbillion hubbard uses example make point weak risk management methodology  huge consequences following brief history risk management historical times present hubbard presents list common methods risk management these expert intuition essentially based gut feeling expert audit based expert intuition independent consultants typically involves development checklists also uses stratification methods see next point simple stratification methods risk matrices canonical example stratification methods weighted scores assigned scores different criteria scores usually assigned expert intuition followed weighting based perceived importance criterion nonprobabilistic financial analysis techniques computing financial consequences best worst case scenarios calculus preferences structured decision analysis techniques multiattribute utility theory analytic hierarchy process these techniques based expert judgements however cases multiple judgements involved techniques ensure judgements logically consistent ie contradict principles logic probabilistic models involves building probabilistic models risk events probabilities  based historical data empirical observation even intuition  book essentially builds case evaluating risks using probabilistic models provides advice built  book also discusses state risk management practice end assessed surveys carried  economist protiviti aon corporation hubbard notes surveys based largely selfassessments risk management effectiveness  place much confidence selfassessments risk subject well known psychological effects cognitive biases tendencies base judgements flawed perceptions dunningkruger effect overconfidence ones abilities  acid test assessment whether use sound quantitative measures many firms surveyed fail count quantify risks well claim assigning weighted scores qualitative judgements count sound quantitative technique later so good ways measuring effectiveness risk management hubbard lists following statistics based large samples use depends availability historical data similar situation hand direct evidence risk management technique actually finds problem found otherwise for example audit unearths dubious financial practices component testing even  isnt able test method endtoend may possible test specific components make method for example method uses computer simulations may possible validate simulations applying known situations check completeness organisations need ensure risk management methods cover entire spectrum risks else theres danger mitigating  risk may increase probability another further hubbard states a risk thats even radar managed as far completeness concerned four perspectives need taken account these internal completeness covering parts organisation external completeness covering external entities organisation interacts historical completeness involves covering worst case scenarios historical data combinatorial completeness involves considering combinations events may occur together may lead commonmode failure discussed earlier finally hubbard closes first section observation better use formal methodology use  flawed why because flawed methodology  lead incorrect decision made high confidence why broken hubbard begins section identifying four major players risk management game these actuaries these perhaps first modern professional risk managers they use quantitative methods manage risks insurance pension industry although methods actuaries use generally sound profession slow pick new techniques further many investment decisions insurance companies come purview actuaries so actuaries typically cover entire spectrum organizational risks physicists mathematicians many rigorous risk management techniques came statistical research done second world war hubbard therefore calls group war quants  notable techniques come effort monte carlo method originally proposed nick metropolis john neumann stanislaw ulam technique calculate averaged trajectories neutrons fissile material see article nick metropolis firstperson account method developed hubbard believes monte carlo simulations offer sound general technique quantitative risk analysis consequently spends fair pages discussing methods albeit basic level more later economists risk analysts investment firms often use quantitative techniques economics popular techniques include modern portfolio theory models options theory blackscholes model  problem models often based questionable assumptions for example blackscholes model assumes rate return stock normally distributed ie value lognormally distributed assumption thats demonstrably incorrect witnessed events last years another way economics plays role risk management behavioural studies particular recognition decisions regarding future events risks stock prices subject cognitive biases hubbard suggests role cognitive biases risk management consistently overlooked see post entitled cognitive biases metarisks followup point management consultants in hubbards view management consultants standards institutes largely responsible many adhoc approaches risk management a particular favourite folks adhoc scoring methods involve ordering risks based subjective criteria  scores assigned risks thus subject cognitive bias even worse tools used scoring  end ordering risks incorrectly bottom line many risk analysis techniques used consultants standards justification following discussion main players risk arena hubbard discusses confusion associated definition risk there plethora definitions risk originated academia hubbard shows contradict others downright nonintuitive incorrect in clarifies academic professional terminology around risk as example takes exception notion risk good thing pmi definition views risk uncertain event condition occurs positive negative effect project objective  definition contradicts common dictionary usage term risk generally includes bad stuff hubbards opinion may raise eyebrows hackles project management circles i reckon point in opinion important sections book chapters hubbard discusses expert knowledge opinions favoured standards methodologies flawed popular scoring method risk matrices worse useless see posts limitations scoring techniques coxs risk matrix theorem detailed discussions points a major problem expert estimates overconfidence to overcome hubbard advocates using calibrated probability assessments quantify analysts abilities make estimates calibration assessments involve getting analysts answer trivia questions eliciting confidence intervals answer  confidence intervals checked proportion correct answers essentially assesses experts abilities estimates tracking often right it found people  improve ability make subjective estimates calibration training ie repeated calibration testing followed feedback see site probability calibration next hubbard tackles several red herring arguments commonly offered reasons manage risks using rigorous quantitative methods among arguments quantitative risk analysis impossible unexpected events predicted risks measured accurately hubbard states first objection invalid although events spectacular stockmarket crashes may overlooked models doesnt prove quantitative risk whole flawed as discusses later book many models go wrong assuming gaussian probability distributions fattailed ones appropriate of course given limited data difficult figure distributions right  so although hubbards argument correct offers little comfort analyst model events occur as far second concerned hubbard written another book just business variable even intangible ones  measured  book makes persuasive case quantities interest  measured difficulties first figuring factors affect variable straightforward task it depends among things availability reliable data analysts experience etc second much depends judgement analyst judgements subject bias although calibration may help reduce certain biases overconfidence means panacea biases third riskrelated measurements generally involve events yet occur consequently measurements based incomplete information to make progress  often make additional assumptions may justifiable priori hubbard strong advocate quantitative techniques monte carlo simulations managing risks however believes often used incorrectly specifically they often used without empirical data validation ie inputs results tested observation are generally used piecemeal ie used parts organisation often manage lowlevel operational risks they frequently focus variables important easier measure rather important hubbard calls perverse occurrence measurement inversion he contends analysts often exclude important variables considered uncertain they use inappropriate probability distributions  normal distribution bell curve always appropriate for example see posts inherent uncertainty project task estimates intuitive discussion form probability distribution project task durations they account correlations variables hubbard contends many analysts simply ignore correlations risk variables ie treat variables independent actually arent  almost always leads underestimation risk correlations  cause feedback effects common mode failures hubbard dismisses argument rigorous quantitative methods monte carlo hard i agree principles behind monte carlo techniques arent hard follow i take opportunity plug article entitled an introduction monte carlo simulations project tasks as far practice concerned several commercially available tools automate much mathematical heavylifting i wont recommend search using key phrase monte carlo simulation tool  reveal many how fix  last part book outlines hubbards recommendations improving practice risk management most material presented draws previous section book his main suggestions adopt language tools philosophy uncertain systems to recommends using calibrated probabilities express uncertainties hubbard believes person makes estimates  used models calibrated he offers suggestions people  improve ability estimate calibration discussed earlier web site employing quantitative modelling techniques model risks in particular advocates use monte carlo methods model risks he also provides list commercially available pcbased monte carlo tools hubbard makes point modelling forces analysts decompose systems interest understand relationships components see point developing understanding basic rules probability including independent events conditional probabilities bayes theorem he gives examples situations rules  help analysts extrapolate to i also add important understand idea estimate isnt number probability distribution ie range numbers probability attached build validate test models using reality ultimate arbiter models built iteratively testing assumption observation further models need incorporate mechanisms ie observations just raw observations  often hard least models incorporate correlations variables note correlations often always indicative underlying mechanism see post introductory example monte carlo simulation involving correlated variables lobbying risk management given appropriate visibility organisations in penultimate chapter book hubbard fleshes characteristics traits good risk analysts as mentions several times book risk analysis empirical science arises experience so although analytical mathematical modelling aspects risk important good analyst must empiricist ie believe knowledge risks  come observation reality in particular tesing models seeing well match historical data tracking model predictions absolutely critical aspects risk analysts job unfortunately many analysts measure performance risk models hubbard offers excellent suggestions analysts  refine improve models via observation finally hubbard emphasises importance creating organisationwide approach managing risks  ensures organisations  tackle important risks first risk management budgets  spent effective way many tools approaches suggests book effective used consistent way across entire organisation in reality though risk management languishes way priorities senior executives even profess understanding importance managing risks rigorous way rarely offer risk managers organisational visibility support need jobs
