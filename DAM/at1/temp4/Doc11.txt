issue based information system ibis notation invented horst rittel werner kunz early s ibis best known use dialogue mapping collaborative approach tackling wicked problems ie contentious issues organisations it range applications well capturing knowledge good example ill much say later post over last five years i written fair bit ibis blog book i coauthored dialogue mapping expert paul culmsee  present post reprises article i wrote five years ago whence notation practical aspects notation grammar etc well origins advantages limitations my motivations revisiting piece revise update original discussion important cover recent developments ibis technology open interesting possibilities area knowledge management to appreciate power ibis best begin understanding context notation invented ill therefore start discussion origins notation followed introduction finally ill cover development last odd years focusing recent developments i mentioned wicked origins a good place start started ibis first described paper entitled issues elements information systems written horst rittel man coined term wicked problem werner kunz july they state intent behind ibis first line abstract paper issuebased information systems ibis meant support coordination planning political decision processes ibis guides identification structuring settling issues raised problemsolving groups provides information pertinent discourse rittels preoccupation area public policy planning also context defined term wicked problem originally given background surprise rittel kunz foresaw ibis type information system meant support work cooperatives like governmental administrative agencies committees planning groups etc confronted problem complex order arrive plan decision  problems tackled cooperatives paradigmdefining examples wicked problems from start ibis intended tool facilitate collaborative approach solving better managing wicked problem helping develop shared perspective a brief introduction ibis  ibis notation consists following three elements issuesor questions issues debated typically issues framed questions lines what x x issue interest group for example case group executives x might rapidly changing market condition whereas case group it people x ageing system hard replace ideasor positions responses questions for example  ideas offered it group might replace said system newer  typically whole set ideas respond issue discussion represents spectrum participant perspectives issue arguments  pros arguments cons arguments issue  complete set arguments respond idea represents multiplicity viewpoints compendium freeware tool  used create ibis maps  downloaded in compendium ibis elements described represented nodes shown figure issues represented bluegreen question marks positions yellow light bulbs pros green signs cons red signs compendium supports node types part core ibis notation nodes  linked ways specified ibis grammar i discuss next figure ibis elements figure ibis elements  ibis grammar  summarized three simple rules issues  raised anew  arise issues positions arguments in words ibis element  questioned in compendium notation question node  connect ibis node ideas  respond questions ie compendium light bulb nodes  link question nodes  arrow pointing idea question depicts responds relationship arguments  associated ideas ie compendium nodes  link light bulb nodes arrows pointing latter  legal links summarized figure figure legal links ibis figure legal links ibis yes simple  rules best illustrated example follow links see illustrations ibis action see postfor simple example dialogue mapping see postor  examples argument visualisation note using ibis map structure written arguments called issue mapping see  example paul children  example also features book made appearance book now know ibis works seen examples action time trace history notation early days present operation early systems when rittel kunz wrote paper three ibistype systems operation two government agencies us  presumes  university environment quite possibly berkeley rittel worked although seems quaint oldfashioned now surprise manual paperbased systems effort expense involved computerizing systems early s prohibitive payoff questionable  rittelkunz paper introduced earlier also offers short description early ibis systems operated an initially unstructured problem area topic denotes task named trigger phrase urban renewal baltimore  war tax reform about topic subtopics discourse develops issues brought disputed different positions rittels word ideas responses assumed arguments constructed defense different positions issue settled convincing opponents decided formal decision procedure frequently questions fact directed experts fed documentation system answers obtained  questioned turned issues through counterplay questioning arguing participants form exert judgments incessantly developing structured pictures problem solutions it possible separate understanding problem phase information solution since every formulation problem also statement potential solution even today forty years later excellent description ibis used facilitate common understanding complex problems moreover process reaching shared understanding whether using ibis  key ways knowledge created within organizations to foreshadow point i  elaborate later using ibis capture key issues ideas arguments connections results navigable map knowledge generated discussion fast forward couple decades in paper published entitled gibis a hypertext tool exploratory policy discussion conklin begeman describe prototype graphical hypertextbased ibistype system called gibis use capturing design rationale yes despite title paper capturing design rationale policy discussions  development gibis represents key step original rittelkunz version ibis recent version implemented compendium amongst things ibis finally paper disk opening world new possibilities gibis aimed offer users  ability capture design rationale options discussed including ones rejected discussion around pros cons a platform promoting computermediated collaborativedesign work ideally situations participants located sites remote  ability store large amount information able navigate intuitive way  gibis prototype proved successful enough catalyse development questmap commercially available software tool supported ibis in recent conversation jeff conklin mentioned questmap  earliest windowsbased groupware tools available market won bestofshow award category it interesting note contrast questmap longer exists compendium singleuser desktop software  primary application questmap area sensemaking helping groups reach collective understanding complex situations might otherwise lead tense adversarial conditions indeed precisely rittel kunz intended ibis used  key advantage offered computerized ibis systems  map dialogues realtime map representing points raised conversation along logical connections  proved big step forward use ibis help groups achieve shared understanding complex issues that said although notable early successes realtime use ibis industry environments see paper example accompanied widespread adoption technique it worth exploring reasons briefly  tacitness ibis mastery  reasons lack traction ibistype techniques realtime knowledge capture discussed paper shum et al entitled hypermedia support argumentationbased rationale years gibis qoc  reasons give for acceptance system must offer immediate value person using quoting paper no designer  expected altruistically enter quality design rationale solely possible benefit possibly unknown person unknown point future unknown task there must immediate value such immediate value obvious novice users ibistype systems there effort involved gaining fluency use ibisbased software tools it users  gain appreciation value tools overcoming limitations mapping design arguments paper whiteboards etc while rules ibis simple grasp intellectual effort cognitive overhead using ibis real time involves teasing issues ideas arguments dialogue classifying points raised issues ideas arguments naming describing point succinctly relating linking point existing map anticipating  fit later developing sense conversational patterns expertise skills  developed sustained practice surprise beginners find hard use ibis map dialogues indeed use ibis realtime conversation mapping tacit skill much like riding bike swimming  mastered making sense ibis despite difficulties mastering ibis easy see offers considerable advantages conventional methods documenting discussions indeed rittel kunz well aware their paper contains nice summary advantages i paraphrase ibis  bridge gap discussions records discussions minutes audiovideo transcriptions etc ibis sits two acting shortterm memory  paper thus foreshadows use issuebased systems aid organizational project memory many elements issues ideas arguments come discussion contextual meanings different preexisting definitions that interpretation points made questions raised depends circumstances surrounding discussion what important contextual meaning important formal meaning ibis captures former clear way example response question what mean x elicits meaning x context discussion subsequently captured idea position ill much say towards end article  reasoning used discussions made transparent supporting opposing evidence  state argument discussion time  inferred glance unlike case written records see post advantages visual documentation prose often times happens commonality issues similar issues might important precise meaning to quote paper description subject matter terms librarians documentalists sic may less significant similarity issue issues dealt previously information used treatment  less issue now search technologies however search technologies still largely based keywords rather context a properly structured contextsearchable ibisbased archive useful conventional documentbased system as ill discuss next section technology now available to sum although ibis offers means map arguments lacking ability make maps available searchable across organization ibis enterprise it interesting note compendium unlike predecessor questmap singleuser desktop tool enable sharing maps across enterprise to sure possible work around limitation workarounds somewhat clunky a recent advance ibis technology addresses issue rather elegantly seven sigma australian consultancy founded paul culmsee chris tomich peter chow developed glyma pronounced glimmer product makes ibis available collaboration platforms like microsoft sharepoint  gamechanger enables sharing searching ibis maps across enterprise moreover shall see implications go beyond sharing search full disclosure as regular readers blog know paul good friend jointly written book papers however time writing i commercial association seven sigma my comments based playing beta version product paul kind enough give access well discussions i figure ibis glyma figure ibis glyma click see larger picture  look feel glyma much compendium see fig keystrokes shortcuts quite similar i trialled glyma weeks feel overall experience actually bit better compendium for example   navigate series maps submaps using breadcrumb trail another example documents videos embedded within map  need leave map order view tagged media unless course  wants see higher resolution i wont go detail product features etc since kind information best accessed source ie product website documentation instead i  now focus glyma addresses longstanding gap knowledge management systems revisiting problem context in organisations knowledge artefacts documents audiovisual media stored hierarchical relational structures example folder within directory structure relational database to sure stored artefacts often tagged metadata indicating created experience tells metadata useful  problem context artefact created typically captured anyone read document wondered what earth authors thinking wrote encountered problem missing context context though hard capture critically important understanding content knowledge artefact any artefact accessed without appreciation context created liable misinterpreted partially understood capturing context enterprise glyma addresses issue context rather elegantly level enterprise ill illustrate point inspiring case study innovative use sharepoint education paul written time ago  case study here backstory pauls words earlier year i met louis zulli jnr teacher florida part program called centre advanced technologies we cokeynoting conference came i droned common sharepoint governance mistakes  majority lous presentation showcased whole bunch sharepoint powered solutions students written  solutions impressive we treated examples like ios android windows phone apps leveraged sharepoint display teachers assignments school events class times silverlight based application providing virtual tour campus integration sharepoint moodle open source learning platform an academic planner web application allowing students plan classes submit schedule reviewed track credits classes selected whether students selections meet graduation requirements all developed year olds level quality i know sharepoint consultancies jealous although examples highlighted louis impressive paul found interesting anecdotes lou related dedication persistence students displayed work quoting paul so demos impressive enough actually impressed in fact hooked slide deck it anecdotes lou told dedication students task went getting things done he spoke students working various school breaks get projects completed leveraged others various skills strengths lous final slide summed talk brilliantly students want make difference give right project incredible things make project meaningful let serve purpose campus community learn listen if students better way if idea let explore invest success early make sure infrastructure guarantee uptime development farm every situation different harm failure i failed ive found ways wont work thomas a edison in brief points highlight fact lous primary role director center create conditions make possible students great work  commerciallevel quality work turned students suggests lous knowledge build highperforming teams definitely worth capturing  question whats best way short getting visit talk experiences seeing forest trees paul recently interviewed lou intent documenting lous experiences  conversation recorded video glymafied ie video mapped using ibis see figure figure knowledge capture via glyma figure knowledge capture via glyma click see larger picture there points worth noting  content entire conversation mapped   see conversation glance  context particular point ie content node made clarified connections node neighbours moving left node gives higher level picture moving right drills details of course reader  noted core ibis capabilities available compendium ibis tool glyma offers much consider following relevant documents audio visual media  tagged specific nodes provide supplementary material in case video recording tagged specific nodes related points made video clicking play icon attached node plays segment content node discussed  really nice feature saves user watch whole video play extended game ffwdrew get point interest moreover provides additional context captured map for example   attach papers links web pages slideshare presentations etc fill background context glyma integrated enterprise content management system design   therefore link map video content powerful builtin search content aggregation features systems for example users able enter search intranet home page retrieve traditional content documents also stories reflections anecdotes experts lou another critical aspect intranet integration ability provide maps contextual navigation amazons ability sell books people never intended buy example power navigation  ability execute kinds queries outlined previous point along contextual information user profile details previous activity intranet area intranet user browsing makes possible present recommendations nodes maps may potential interest users such targeted recommendations might encourage users explore video rich media content technical aside an interesting underthehood feature glyma uses implementation hypergraph database store maps note database  store representations graphs maps edge  connect vertices these databases enable storing general graph structures what means glyma  extended store kind map mind maps concept maps argument maps whatever nodes  shared across maps  feature developed yet i mention offers exciting possibilities future to summarise since glyma stores data enterpriseclass database maps  made available across organization it offers ability tag nodes pretty much kind media documents audiovideo clips etc   tag specific parts media relevant content node snippet video example moreover sophisticated search capabilities platform enable context aware search specifically  search nodes keywords tags node interest located  also view maps appears  maps inform us contexts relating node  ability display contextual environment piece information makes glyma really interesting in metaphorical terms glyma enables us see forest trees conclude my aim post introduce readers ibis notation trace history origins issue mapping recent developments knowledge management  history technique valuable gives insight rationale behind creation leads better understanding different ways  used indeed exaggeration say knowledge management applications discussed extension rittels original reasons inventing ibis i like close piece couple observations experience ibis firstly real surprise technique  capture written arguments conversations despite three distinct elements simple grammar yes require thought particularly mapping discussions real time however cognitive overhead good forces mapper think whats said instead just writing blind thoughtful transcription aim game when done right results map truly reflects understanding complex issue secondly although current discussions ibis focus applications dialogue mapping important role play mapping organizational knowledge maps offer powerful means navigate complex network knowledge within organisation  aspirational endgoal effort global knowledge map highlights interconnections different kinds knowledge exists within organization to sure map  make little sense human eye powerful search capabilities make navigable to extent feasible direction i foresee ibis becoming important skill repertoire knowledge management professionals
