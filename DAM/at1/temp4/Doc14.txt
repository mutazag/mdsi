jack see discussion going nowhere group talking pros cons competing approaches half hour kept going around circles as mulled jack got idea hed playing around visual notation called ibis issuebased information system looking opportunity use map discussion real time editors note readers unfamiliar ibis may want look post one proceeding why give try thought i cant worse lot decision made waited break conversation dived got one  i suggestion said theres conversation mapping tool ive exploring i believe might help us reach common understanding approaches weve discussing it may even help facilitate decision do mind i try pfft im helps us get decision said max hed clearly enough jack looked around table mary looked puzzled nodded assent rick seemed unenthusiastic didnt voice objections andrew boss herehegoesagain look face jack track record ideas jacks surprise said ok why go give minute get set said jack he hooked computer data projector within couple minutes blank ibis map displayed onscreen this done glanced others looking screen expressions ranging curiosity mary skepticism max just words im going said ill using notation called ibis issue based information system capture discussion ibis three elements issues ideas arguments ill explain go along ok lets get started figuring want discussion whats aim asked his starting spiel done jack glanced colleagues max seemed tad skeptical rick ever bored andrew mary stared screen no one said anything just prompt asking another question mary said id say explore options implementing new system find suitable one phrased question how implement system x jack glanced others they seemed agree least didnt disagree mary excellent said i think thats good summary trying he drew question node map continued most discussions kind aimed resolving issues questions our root question what options implementing system x mary put how implement system x figure figure so whats next asked max he still looked skeptical jack see intrigued not bad thought   well next step explore ideas address resolve issue so ideas responses question implement system x any suggestions wed engage consultants said max we dont inhouse skills implement jack created idea node map began typing ok hire consultants said he looked others continued in ibis ideas depicted light bulbs since ideas respond questions i draw arrow idea root question like figure figure i think option said mary wed need training might take us longer wed learning job viable option good said jack youve given us another option ways might go implementing option ideally node represent single atomic point so ill capture youve said like he typed fast drawing nodes filling detail as wrote said mary said thats clearly new idea implementation option she also partly described might go training learn technology learning job ive added how question two points describe wed ideas responding question he paused looked around check every one continued but theres also mentioned shortcoming will take longer i capture argument idea con depicted red minus map he paused briefly look handiwork onscreen asked any questions figure figure rick asked are rules governing nodes connected good question in nutshell ideas respond questions arguments respond ideas issues hand can generated type node i can give links references web youre interested that might useful everyone said andrew send us sure lets move so anyone options ummnot sure work codevelopment suggested rick do mean collaborative development external resources asked jack began typing yes confirmed rick figure figure what costs we limited budget said mary good point said jack started typing this constraint must satisfied potential approaches he stopped typing looked others this important criteria apply potential approaches criterial question hang root node said does make sense everyone figure figure im sure i understand said andrew why criteria separate approaches they arent separate theyre level higher specific approach apply solutions put another way relate root issue how implement system x rather specific solution ah makes sense said andrew this notation seems pretty powerful it ill happy show features later lets continue discussion now are criteria well must priority features described scoping document implemented end year said andrew one can always count manager emphasise constraints ok thats two criteria actually must implement priority features must implement year end said jack added new nodes no surprises continued three classic project constraints budget scope time figure figure the others now engaged map looking making notes etc jack wanted avoid driving discussion instead suggesting move things forward asked what consider next i cant think approaches said mary does anyone suggestions look pros cons listed approaches ive said ill say i think dumsorry good idea it fraught much risk  started max no isnt countered mary contrary hiring externals risky costs can blowout much good points said jack noted marys point max specific risks mind figure figure time can take much longer said max weve already captured con doitourselves approach said jack hmmthats true i reword state hard deadline perhaps say may finish allotted time something similar thats good point said jack changed node read higher risk meeting deadline the map coming along nicely now full attention folks room figure figure alright continued cons if pros arguments support approaches thats easy said mary will improve knowledge technology well able support maintain system doing consultants will enable us complete project quicker countered max jack added pros paused giving group time reflect map figure figure rick mary sitting next whispered sideconversation going andrew max writing something jack waited mary i idea said rick we take approach combines best worlds external consultants internal resources actually weve already got separate approach codevelopment havent discussed yet he groups attention now codevelopment allows us use consultants expertise really need develop skills yes wed need put thought work i think i cant see codevelopment will reduce time risk will take longer consultants said max true said mary better important enables us develop inhouse skills needed support maintain application in long run can add huge saving just last week i read maintenance can anywhere percent total system costs so youre saying reduces implementation time results smaller exposure cost blowout asked jack yes said mary jack added pros waited figure figure i still dont see reduces time said max it compared option retorted mary wait second guys said jack what i reword pros read reduced implementation time compared inhouse option reduced cost compared external option he looked mary max seemed ok typed changes figure figure jack asked so issues ideas arguments anyone like add from whats map seems codevelopment best option said andrew he looked around see others thought rick mary nodding max still looked doubtful max asked going figure it isnt easy partition work cleanly teams different levels expertise jack typed con figure figure good point said andrew there may ways address concern do think help brought consultants daylong engagement workshop codevelopment approach team max nodded yeah might work said its worth try anyway i reservations codevelopment seems best three approaches great said andrew ill get consultants next week help us workshop approach jack typed exchange others started gather things anything else add asked everyone looked map no thats i think said mary looks good said mike be sure send us copy map figure figure sure ill print copies right away said jack since weve developed together shouldnt points disagreement thats true said andrew another good reason use tool gathering papers asked is anything else he looked around table alright ill see guys later im get lunch next meeting jack looked around group helped along ibis facilitation theyd overcome differences reached collective decision he thought wouldnt work jack thanks help discussion ibis seems great way capture discussions dont forget send us references said mary gathering notes ill right away said jack ill also send information compendium opensource software tool i used create map great said mary ive got run see later see later replied jack
