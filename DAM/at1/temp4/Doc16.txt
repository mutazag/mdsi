ive written number posts complexity projects covering topics ranging conceptual issues models project complexity despite verbiage ive never addressed key issue complexity handled methodologists claim justification complexity can tamed adequate planning together appropriate controlling monitoring project progresses yet personal experience accounts many others suggests beast remains untamed a weeks ago i read brilliant series articles paul culmsee discusses technique called dialogue mapping among things may prove dragonslayer in post i present overview technique illustrate utility reallife project situations first brief history dialogue mapping roots wicked problems problems hard solve even define satisfy one criteria note relationship problem wickedness project complexity projects set address solve wicked problems generally complex converse necessarily true see post over three decades ago horst rittel man coined term wicked problem colleague werner kunz developed technique called issue based information system ibis aid understanding problems ibis based premise wicked problems contentious issues can understood discussing terms three essential elements issues questions ideas answers arguments ideas ibis subsequently refined years various research groups independent investigators jeff conklin inventor dialogue mapping one main contributors effort now beauty ibis easy learn basically three elements mentioned earlier issues ideas arguments can connected ways specified ibis grammar the elements syntax language can illustrated half page i shall minute before i mention excellent free software tool compendium supports ibis notation i use discussion demo i recommend download install compendium proceeding go ill wait   ok lets begin ibis three elements illustrated compendium map ibis elements figure ibis elements the elements question issue thats discussed analysed note term question synonymous issue idea response question an idea responds question sense offers potential resolution clarification question argument argument favour idea pro con the arrows show links relationships elements thats far elements ibis concerned the ibis grammar specifies legal ways elements can linked the rules nicely summarised following diagram figure legal links ibis figure legal links ibis in nutshell rules any element question idea agument can questioned ideas respond questions arguments make case ideas note questions argued simple isnt essentially thats ibis so whats ibis got dialogue mapping well dialogue mapping facilitation group discussion using shared display display everyone participating discussion can see add typically facilitator drives ie modifies display seeking input participants using ibis notation capture issues ideas arguments come this synchronous realtime application ibis described conklins book dialogue mapping building shared understanding wicked problems an absolute mustread manage complex projects diverse stakeholders for completeness worth pointing ibis can also used asynchronously example dissecting arguments presented papers articles this application ibis essentially dialogue mapping minus facilitation sometimes called issue mapping i now describe simple realistic application dialogue mapping adapted reallife case for brevity i wont reproduce entire dialogue instead ill describe dialogue map develops discussion progresses the example simple illustration ibis can used facilitate shared understanding solution problem all set ok lets go  the situation our finance data mart updated overnight batch job takes hours this good enough purposes however small vocal number users need able report transactions occurred within last hour waiting next day especially monthend simply option the dev team figure best way the location office the players two colleagues it one finance the shared display compendium running computer visible players the discussion launched issue stated upfront how update data mart business hours my colleagues dev team came several ideas address issue after capturing issue responding ideas map looked like figure map stage figure map stage in brief options use messaging infrastructure carry update write database triggers transaction tables these triggers update data mart tables directly indirectly write custom tsql procedures ssis package carry update database sql server run relevant already existing extract transform load etl procedures frequent intervals possibly several times day as discussion progressed developers raised arguments ideas a little later map looked like figure map stage figure map stage note data latency refers time interval transaction occurs propagation data mart complexity rough measure effort required time implement option i wont go arguments detail largely selfexplanatory the business rep asked often etl run the relevant portions can run hourly really want replied etl queen thats good enough said business rep  voilà solution the final map looked much like previous one additions business reps question developers response node marking decision made figure final map figure final map note decision node simply idea accepted parties decision issue discussed admittedly little example nowhere near complex project however dismissing outright consider following benefits afforded process dialogue mapping everyones point view taken account the shared display served focal point discussion entire group contributed development map further points arguments made represented map the display discussion around ensured common shared understanding problem once shared understanding achieved business it case solution almost obvious the finished map serves intuitive summary discussion participant can go back recall essential structure discussion way thats almost impossible written document if think thats tall claim heres challenge try reconstructing meeting written minutes enough said i think but perhaps simple example leaves unconvinced if i urge read jeff conklins reflections industrial strength casestudy dialogue mapping despite limited practical experience technique i believe useful way address issues arise complex projects particularly involving stakeholders diverse points view thats say panacea project complexity nothing from purely pragmatic perspective may viewed addition project managers toolchest communication techniques for ive noted elsewhere a shared worldview includes common understanding tools terminology culture politics etc enables effective communication within project group dialogue mapping provides practical means achieve shared understanding
