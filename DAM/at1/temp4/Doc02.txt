enterprise risk management erm refers process uncertainties identified analysed managed organizationwide perspective in principle perspective enables organisations deal risks holistic manner avoiding silo mentality plagues much risk management practice  claim made erm rate practitioners accept however whether claim really holds another matter altogether unfortunately available critiques erm

first article june issue internal auditor coso perspective erm in frameworks focus much quantifying risks primarily financial measures establishing accountability managing risks systematic way all sounds sensible uncontroversial so wheres problem  problems erm  author paper begins observation basic aim erm identify risks  affect organisations objectives design controls mitigation strategies reduce risks collectively predetermined value specified organisations risk appetite operationally identified risks monitored corrective action taken go beyond limits specified controls much like operation thermostat in view risk management mechanistic process failures risk management seen due right implementation failure politics getting way organizational friction rather problem framework  basic design framework rarely questioned contrary common wisdom author paper believes design erm flawed following three ways  idea single organisationwide risk appetite simplistic  assumption risk  dealt detailed processbased rules suitable audit control questionable  undue focus developing financial metrics controls blind bigger picture interconnected risks quantified controlled mechanisms well now take look detail appetite vs appetisation as mentioned earlier risk appetite defined risk organisation willing bear although erm frameworks allow qualitative measures risk appetite organisations implementing erm tend prefer quantitative ones  problem definition risk appetite  vary significantly across organization for example sales audit functions within organisation  different appetites risk as another example familiar anyone reads news usually big significant gap risk appetites financial institutions regulatory authorities  difference risk appetites different stakeholder groups manifestation fact risk social construct different stakeholder groups view given risk different ways may even see certain risks risks witness behaviour certain financial masters universe since single organisationwide risk appetite difficult come author suggests different approach  takes account multiplicity viewpoints organisation process calls risk appetizing  involves getting diverse stakeholders achieve consensus agreement constitutes risk appetite power argues process reconciling different viewpoints risk lead realistic view risk organization willing bear quoting paper conceptualising risk appetising process might better direct risk management attention likely lacking namely multiplicity interactions shape operational ethical boundaries level organizational practice cosostyle erm principles effectively limit concept risk appetite within capital measurement discourse framing risk appetite process ethics incentives formed reformed exclude technical conception bring closer insights several decades organization theory explicitly acknowledging diversity viewpoints risk likely closer reality conflictual pluralistic model descriptive organizations actually work makes lower demands organizational political rationality produce single appetite explicitly recognising institutionalising processes different appetites values  mediated such process difficult involves getting people different viewpoints agree constitutes sensible definition risk appetite a process bias a bigger problem powers view erm frameworks overemphasise financial accounting measures processes means quantifying controlling risk as puts erm fundamentally accountingdriven blueprint emphasises controlsbased approach risk management  design emphasis means efforts implementation  inherent tendency elaborate detailed controls corresponding documents trails  problem leads rulebased compliance mentality wherein risks managed mechanical manner using bureaucratic processes substitute real thought risks managed such process may work makebelieve world risks known unlikely work  great deal ambiguity power makes important point rulebased compliance chews organizational resources  tangible effort expended compliance serves reassure organizations something manage risks  dangerous lulls false sense security rulebased compliance lays regulations met requires extensive evidence audit trails box checking all demands considerable work daily pressure operational staff process regulatory requirements yet despite workload volume pressure also cognitively comfortable world focuses inwards routine systems controls  auditability controls architecture  theorized defence anxiety enables organizational agents feel work conforms legitimised principles in comfortable prescriptive world processbased risk management little time imagine explore else go wrong further latter often avoided difficult often uncomfortable process imagination alternative futures likely involve production discomfort compared formal comfort auditing  approach  take form scenario analysis participants different disciplines organization  collectively track trajectory potential decisions events  process

responding challenge a limited view embeddedness  imperatives erm embed risk management within organisations among things entails incorporating risk management explicitly job descriptions making senior managers responsible managing risks although step right direction power argues concept embeddeness articulated erm remains limited focuses specific business entities ignoring wider environment context exist  essential always obvious connections entities necessarily accounted as power puts erm systems represent embeddedness sense interconnectedness proponents seem demand intensification embedding individual entity level yet latter kind embedding compliance driven risk management epitomised sarbanesoxley legislation arguably disaster tying resources much worse cognition attention auditized representations business processes in short focus following processoriented approach risk management mandated frameworks potential defocus attention risks less obvious potentially significant addressing limitations power believes flaws erm  addressed looking practice business continuity management bcm bcm addresses issue disaster management ie keep organisation functioning event disaster consequently significant overlap aims bcm erm however unlike erm bcm draws specialists different fields emphasizes collective action such approach therefore likely take holistic view risk real point regardless approach  takes point involve diverse stakeholders work towards shared enterprisewide understanding risks only  possible develop risk management plan incorporates varying even contradictory perspectives exist within organisation there many techniques work towards shared understanding risks issues matter some discussed length book conclusion power suggests erm articulated bodies cas coso flawed it attempts quantify risk appetite organizational level essentially impossible task different organizational stakeholders  different views risk risk social construct it advocates controls rulebased approach managing risks such prescriptive best practice approach discourages debate dialogue risks consequently many viewpoints missed quite possibly many risks despite rhetoric erm implemented risk management controls processes often overlook connections dependencies entities within organisations so although risk management appears embedded within organisation reality may power suggests erm practice learn lessons business continuity management bcm particular interconnected nature business risks collective action needed tackle indeed approach attempts reconcile diverse risk viewpoints  huge improvement current practice until erm  continue illusion offering false comfort responsible managing risk
