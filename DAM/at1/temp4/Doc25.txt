management practiced largely getting things done consequently management education research tends focus improving means specified ends achieved  ends questioned rigorously  truth reflected high profile corporate scandals come light last decade mention global financial crisis today ever need new kind management practice  managers critically reflect goals pursue means aim achieve in book entitled making sense management a critical introduction management academics mats alvesson hugh willmott describe approach management entails  post summary central ideas described book critical theory relevance management  body work alvesson willmott draw critical theory discipline based belief knowledge based dialectical reasoning ie reasoning dialogue rather scientific rationality alone  main reason science commonly practiced value free therefore incapable addressing problems social ethical dimension  idea new even scientists einstein commented limits scientific reasoning although critical theory roots renaissance enlightenment modern avatar largely due group german social philosophers associated frankfurtbased institute social research established s among things philosophers

rationality examples drawn  borg much look chapter book  heretics guide best practices cowritten paul culmsee  demise command control many professional managers see jobs purely technical terms involving things administration planning monitoring etc they tend overlook fact technical functions carried within particular social cultural context more point crucial managers work constraints power domination free think right whatever bosses order turn behave subordinates exactly way as alvesson willmott put managers intermediaries hire manage managers employed coordinate motivate appease control productive efforts others these others necessarily share managerial agendas despite talk autonomy empowerment modern day management still much control however modern day employees unlikely accept command control approach managed organisations taken recourse subtler means achieving result for example organisational culture initiatives aimed getting employees internalisethe values organisation attempts control sans command  point despite softening rhetoric management principal focus remains much days taylor ford a critical look status quo a good place start critical view management area decisionmaking certain decisions particularly made executive levels  long term impact organisation employees business schools decision theory texts tells us decisionmaking rational process unfortunately reality belies claim decisions organisations often made basis politics ideology rather objective criteria  case important decisions subject critical scrutiny indeed possible many crises last decade avoided decisions lead subjected critical review many initiatives launched organisationland origins executivelevel decisions made flimsy grounds best practice recommendations big consulting companies midlevel managers required see completion faced problem justifying initiatives rank file change management modern organisationland largely justifying unjustifiable defending indefensible  critique however goes beyond just practice management for example alvesson willmott also draw attention things objectives organisation they point shortsighted objectives maximising shareholder value lead downfall companies enron moreover also remind us issue becoming increasingly important todays world natural resources unlimited exploited judicious sustainable manner as interesting important big picture issues remainder post ill focus attention management practices impact mid lower level employees a critical look management specialisations alvesson willmott analyse organisational functions human resource management hrm marketing information systems is critical perspective it take far many pages justice discussion ill just present brief summary two areas hr is

since practice is focuses largely technology much is research practice tends focus technology trends best practices as might expected focus fad month thus turns stale rather quickly as examples s saw explosion papers projects business process reengineering flavour decade s serviceoriented architecture recently weve seen great deal hot air cloud underlying lot technology related decisionmaking tacit assumption choices pertaining technology valuefree  decided basis technical financial criteria alone  profession whole tends take overly scientificrational approach design implementation often ignoring issues power politics it  argued many failures largescale is projects due hyperrational approach taken many practitioners in similar vein management specialisations  benefit insights come taking critical perspective alvesson willmott discuss marketing accounting functions however since main interest solutions rather listing rather wellknown problems ill leave directing interested reader book towards enlightened practice management in modern workplace common employees feel disconnected work least time time always in prior post i discussed sense alienation consequence work personal lives played two distinct spheres system lifeworld in brief system refers professional administrative sphere work andor interact institutional authority lifeworld everyday world share others actions lifeworld based shared understanding issue hand whereas system from critical analysis management specialisations presented book evident profession mired paradigm consisting prescriptive topdown practices serves perpetuate system encroaching lifeworld values employees there  say exactly however alvesson wilmott stated book kind thinking perverse ultimately selfdefeating  devaluation lifeworld properties perverse at least system depends upon human beings capable communicating effectively manipulated demoralized point incapable cooperation productivity alvesson willmott use term emancipation describe process whereby employees freed shackles systemoriented thinking even partially note im using term system sense defined confused systems thinking another beast altogether acknowledging impossible level entire organisation even department coin term microemancipation describe process whereby subgroups organisations empowered think issues devise appropriate actions free extent possible management constraints directives although might sound much idealistic readers assured eminently possible implement microemancipatory practices real world organisations see paper  possible framework  used within multiorganisation project along detailed case study shows framework  applied complex project environment alvesson willmott warn emancipatory practices without costs employers employees for example employees gained autonomy may end less productive  turn affect job security in opinion view issue  addressed incrementalist approach wherein employers employees work together come microemancipatory projects grassroots level case study described paper mentioned previous paragraph conclude despite rhetoric autonomy empowerment much presentday management stuck tayloristfordist paradigm in modern day organisations command control may obvious often sneak backdoor notsoobvious ways for example employees almost always know certain things simply bounds discussion consequences breaching unstated boundaries  severe in purest avatar critical approach management seeks remove boundaries altogether  unrealistic nothing  ever get done organisation everything open discussion case social systems compromise necessary  concept microemancipation offers just to sure  go beyond rhetoric empowerment actually creating environment enables people speak minds debate issues openly though impossible level entire organisation definitely possible achieve albeit approximately small workgroups to conclude book worth read just management researchers also practicing managers unfortunately overlyacademic style may turn practitioners people need read
