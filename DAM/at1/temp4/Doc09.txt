anticipating dealing risks important part managing projects so much frameworks methodologies devote fair bit attention risk management example pmi framework considers risk management  nine knowledge areas project management now frameworks methodologies normative us risks managed dont say anything risks actually handled projects it perhaps much expect projects run full machinery formal risk management reasonable expect project managers deal risks less systematic way however project management lore rife stories projects risks managed inadequately managed see post pertinent case studies  begs question rational reasons managing risks projects a paper elmar kutsch mark hall entitled  rational choice not applying project risk management information technology projects addresses question  post summary review paper background  paper begins brief overview risk management prescribed various standards risk management making decisions face uncertainty to make right decisions project managers need figure risks significant consequently methodologies offer techniques rank risks based various criteria these techniques based many rather strong assumptions authors summarise follows an unambiguous identification problem risk including cause perfect information relevant variables affect risk a model risk incorporates aforementioned variables a complete list possible approaches tackle risks an unambiguous quantitative internally consistent measure outcomes approach perfect knowledge consequences approach availability resources successful implementation chosen solution  presence rational decisionmakers ie folks free cognitive bias example most formal methodologies assume selfevidently correct note arent correct see posts cognitive biases project metarisks limitations scoring methods risk analysis anyway regardless validity assumptions clear achieving require great deal commitment effort money  according authors provides hint many projects run without formal risk management in words despite existence selfevidently correct process manage project risk evidence suggests project managers feel restricted applying optimal process manage risks for example lyons skitmore investigated factors limiting implementation risk management australian construction projects similar findings barriers using risk management three hong kong industries found prominent study tummala leung burchett leung  dominant factors constraining use project risk management lack time problem justifying effort project risk management lack information required quantifyqualify risk estimates  authors review research literature find factors reduce likelihood risk management applied projects based findings suggest following reasons project managers often offer justifications rationales managing risks  problem hindsight most risk management methodologies rely historical data calculate probabilities risk eventuation however many managers feel rely data specific unique project  problem ownership risks often thought someone elses problem there often reluctance take ownership risk fear blame case risk response fails address risk  problem cost justification from premises listed clear proper risk management timeconsuming effortladen expensive process many it projects run tight budgets risk management area thats perceived unnecessary expense lack expertise project managers might unaware risk management technique i find hard believe given practically textbooks methodologies yammer great length importance managing risks besides pretty weak justification  problem anxiety by definition risk management implies  considering things  go wrong sometimes informed risks stakeholders may decide go ahead project consequently project managers may limit risk identification efforts attempt avoid making stakeholders nervous when justifying decision manage risks factors often presented barriers problems prevent project manager using risk management as illustration project manager might say i cant talk risks project sponsor  freak throw office research method  authors started exploratory study aimed developing understanding problem perspective it project managers ie project managers actually experience application risk management projects  study done facetoface interviews based patterns emerged study authors developed webbased survey administered wider group project managers  exploratory phase involved eighteen project managers whereas indepth survey completed just hundred project managers members pmi risk management special interest group although paper doesnt say i assume project managers asked questions reference specific project involved perhaps recent  i wont dwell research methodology paper details results interpretation four eighteen project managers interviewed exploratory study apply risk management processes projects  reasons given interpreted authors cost justification hindsight anxiety ive italicized word interpreted previous sentence i believe responses given project managers just easily interpreted another way ive presented arguments readers  judge  interviewee mentioned at beginning much  gave thought tackling risks it simply happen  authors conclude rationale managing risks case  cost justification chain logic due lack time investment resources managing risks justified to seems read much response from response appears real reason exactly interviewee states  thought managing risks ie risks overlooked another interviewee stated it nice differently quite vulnerable terms software development driven states never position proactive  americans say we got update system just released rather telling us week advance something happening we never ahead enough able plan  authors interpret lack risk management case due problem hindsight ie risk update poses parts system anticipated risk management possible to interpretation seems little thin surely project managers understand risks arbitrary updates pose from response appears real reason project manager able plan ahead heshe advance warning updates  seems problem broken project management process rather anything risk management hindsight my point uncertainty known high probability regular updates something done whilst planning project ive dwelt examples appears authors may occasionally fallen trap pigeon holing interviewee responses predefined rationales ones discussed previous section instead listening actually said of course impression based reading paper data presented therein  authors may well unpublished information support classification interviewee responses however case presented data paper reliability second survey depends set predefined rationales comprehensive correct  authors present short discussion second phase study they find formal risk management processes used  third cases studied as authors point interesting statistic especially considering money stake typical it projects in cases risk management applied respondents asked provide reasons  reasons given extremely varied authors pigeonholed predefined categories i present original responses interpretations readers  judge consider following reasons offered respondents applying risk management we havent got time left no executive call risk measurements company doesnt see value adding additional cycles project upper management think required ignorance thing necessary an initial risk analysis done pm bother follow a single risk identification workshop held early project arrival reason following process probably attitude members team interestingly authors interpret responses attributable cost justification rationale however seems several likely interpretations for example attributed lack knowledge value managing risks whereas sound like simple unfortunately rather common buckpassing conclusion towards end paper authors make excellent point rationality decision apply risk management from perspective formal methodoologies decision irrational however rationality lack isnt cut dried heres authors say decision it project manager apply project risk management may described irrational least  accepts premise project manager chose apply selfevidently correct process optimally reduce impact risk project outcome on hand person focuses statistical probability threats impacts ignores information truly irrational hence project manager act sensibly example applying project risk management rates utility using project risk management higher utility confronting stakeholders discomforting information spending money address issues may eventuate matter  point people dont make decisions based prescribed processes procedures alone considerations  authors go say pmi apm claim systematic identification analysis response risk project managers  achieve planned project outcome however findings show onethird projects effectiveness project risk management virtually nonexistent formal project risk management process applied due problem cost justification now although undeniable many projects run risk management whatsoever im sure i agree last statement quote from data presented paper seems likely lack knowledge buckpassing prime reasons risk management given short shrift projects surveyed even cost justification offered rationale interviewees quotes suggest real reasons quite different  isnt surprising natural attribute unacceptable costs attributed oversight failure i think may case large number projects risks arent managed however authors mention impossible make generalisations based small samples so although incontrovertible significant number projects risks arent managed remains open question
