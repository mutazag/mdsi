 meeting going going nowhere finally john came said there way i  days said it  take least week there point contention developer manager now open real work meeting begin two start talking realistic delivery date  manager lets call jack pleased dont tell simple twopage web app done several times i add  take week ok let walk details said john went another half hour jack john arguing reasonable timeframe completing requested work dialogue rationality action most developers designers indeed doers project teams several conversations similar  these folks spend fair bit time discussing matters relating projects work in discussions aim come shared understanding issue discussion shared commitment future action in remainder post ill take look project discussions somewhat philosophical perspective view understanding obstacles open dialogue  addressed when participate discussions want views taken seriously consequently present views statements hope others  see rational ie based sound premises logical thought  presumes john made claim delivery date unrealistic willing present arguments convince jack indeed  point john judged jack others meeting based validity statements john makes when jacks validity claims contested debate ensues aim getting kind agreement  philosophy underlying process discourse simply another word debate dialogue described theory communicative rationality proposed german philosopher jurgen habermas  basic premise communicative rationality rationality reason tied social interactions dialogue in words exercise reason  occur dialogue such communication mutual deliberation result general agreement issues discussion only agreement achieved  consensus actions need taken habermas refers latter communicative action ie action resulting collective deliberation note just clear i read habermas books discussion based entirely secondary sources papers authors studied habermas detail incidentally wikipedia article topic quite good well worth read validity claims since objective project discussions achieve shared understanding issues shared commitment future action  say discussions aimed achieving communicative action  medium mutual understanding achieved speech ie statements speaker makes based perceptions reality others involved dialogue conveying perceptions may may match speakers now statements made discussions implicit explicit validity claims ie express speakers belief something true valid least context dialogue participants disagree speaker essentially contesting claims according theory communicative action every utterance makes following validity claims it makes claim objective external reality johns statement deadline impossible refers timing objective event delivery working software habermas refers truth claim it says something social reality expresses something relationship speaker listeners  relationship typically defined social workplace norms example relationship manager employee case john jack johns statement expression disagreement manager of course believes position justified take week deliver software habermas refers rightness claim it expresses something subjective reality speakers personal viewpoint john believes based experience intutition etc deadline impossible for communication happen jack must work assumption john honest ie john truly believes deadline impossible even though jack may agree habermas refers truthfulness claim  validity claims relation rationality nicely summed wikipedia article communicative rationality i quote by earnestly offering speech act another communication speaker claims say true also normatively right honest moreover speaker implicitly offers justify claims challenged justify reasons thus speaker challenged  offer acceptable reasons normative framework implied offering given speech act speech act unacceptable irrational when john says task going take week implies  justify statement required three ways  take week objective take week normative based rightness truly believes  take week subjective in dialogues validity claims implied rarely tested usually take people say face value dont ask justify claims nevertheless assumed  offer justifications ask naturally  reason doubt validity say it point discourse begins as wener ulrich puts paper in everyday communication validity basis speech often treated unproblematic  purpose consists exchanging information rather examining validity claims none three validity claims made explicit subject discussion it sufficient partners assume anticipate habermas likes say speakers prepared substantiate claims asked times possible participants switch different mode communication  several validity claims actually tested only validity claims indeed become problematic  participants feels compelled dispute either speakers sincerity empirical andor normative content statements ordinary communication breaks discourse begins progress project discussions actually depends breakdown ordinary communication good project decisions emerge open deliberation pros cons competing approaches only done   move action conditions ideal discourse all sounds somewhat idealistic habermas noted five prerequisites open debate they inclusion affected parties included dialogue autonomy participants able present criticise validity claims independently empathy participants must willing listen understand claims made others power neutrality power differences levels authority participants affect discussion transparency participants must indulge strategic actions ie lying in paper bent flyvbjerg adds sixth point group able take long needs achieve consensus flyvbjerg calls requirement unlimited time from list clear open discourse communicative rationality ideal difficult achieve practice nevertheless always possible improve quality dialogue projects behooves us project professionals strive towards ideal in next section ill look  practical way boundary judgements most times discussions jump straight point without bothering explain assumptions underpin statements by glossing assumptions however leave open misunderstood others means assess validity statements consequently becomes difficult empathise us for example john says impossible finish work less week support claim stating assumptions makes bear argument he may assuming work addition stuff plate on hand may assuming much manager may willing reassign stuff someone else unless assumption brought open two  continue argue without reaching agreement werner ulrich pointed issue tacit assumptions unstated frameworks essentially  defining boundaries within ones claims hold he coined term boundary judgement describe facts norms speaker deems relevant statements a boundary judgement determines context within statement holds also determines range validity statement for example john talking deadline impossible context current work situation situation changed might estimate ulrich invented notion boundary critique address point in essence boundary critique way uncover boundary judgements asking right questions according ulrich boundary questions probe assumptions made various stakeholders he classifies boundary questions four categories these motivation includes questions why project who how  measure benefits project done power includes questions who key decisionmaker regarding scope what resources controlled decisionmaker what resources controlled decisionmaker ie relevant environmental factors knowledge  includes what knowledge needed work who ie professionals knowledge what key success factors eg stakeholder consensus management support technical soundness etc legitimation  includes who stakeholders including indirectly affected project how ensure interests stakeholders taken account how  conflicting views project objectives reconciled  questions drawn paper ulrich i paraphrased way makes sense project environments many questions difficult address openly especially relating power legitimation answers often bump organisational politics power  point however questions asked constraints become evident only happens  discourse proceed full knowledge possible isnt before closing section ill note techniques essentially thing i wont discuss ive already exceeded reasonable word count conclusion someone recently mentioned problem project meetings indeed conversation participants see positions rational even consequently stick views even faced evidence contrary according theory communicative rationality however folks arent rational subject positions views trial argumentation rationality lies dialogue individual statements positions a productive discussion  validity claims continually challenged converge optimal decision  best rational position  emerges collective deliberation in closing caveat order complete discussion dialogue projects organisations take entire book my discussion merely highlighted issues technique i daresay rarely touched upon management texts courses there many tools techniques  help improve quality discourse within organisations paul culmsee i discuss book  heretics guide best practices
