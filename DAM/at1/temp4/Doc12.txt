a central myth decision making organisations rational process the qualifier rational refers decisionmaking methods based following broad steps identify available options develop criteria rating options rate options according criteria developed select topranked option the truth decision making organisations generally follow process as i pointed post based article tim van gelder decisions often based mix informal reasoning personal beliefs even leaps faith quoting post formal rational processes often applied one following reasons realworld options often quantified rated meaningful way many lifes dilemmas fall category for example decision accept decline job offer rarely made basis material gain alone even ratings possible can highly subjective for example considering job offer one candidate may give importance financial matters whereas another might consider lifestylerelated matters flexihours commuting distance etc paramount another complication may enough information settle matter conclusively as example investment decisions often made basis quantitative information based questionable assumptions finally problem may wicked ie complex multifaceted difficult analyse using formal decision making methods classic examples wicked problems climate change much say even problem city town planning such problems forced formal decision analysis frameworks meaningful way the main theme running uncertainty most decisions called upon make professional lives fraught uncertainty makes hard rate options adds subjectivity ratings possible magnifies wickedness issue decision making projects need systematic deliberation the important decisions project generally made start sometimes called frontend projects unfortunately information availability lowest consequently uncertainty highest in situations decision makers feel left little choice base decisions instinct intuition now even one bases decision intuition deliberation involved one thinks things weighs options qualitative way unfortunately situations done unsystematic manner moreover decision makers fail record informal reasoning behind decisions as result rationale behind decisions made remain opaque want understand particular choices made a brief introduction ibis clearly one needs means make informal reasoning behind decision explicit now number argument visualisation techniques available purpose i will focus one i worked issuebased information system ibis i will introduce notation briefly those want detailed introduction will find one article entitled the whence issuebased information systems ibis consists three main elements issues questions issues need addressed positions ideas responses questions typically set ideas respond issue represents spectrum perspectives issue arguments can pros arguments supporting cons arguments issue the complete set arguments respond idea represents multiplicity viewpoints the best ibis mapping tool compendium can downloaded in compendium ibis elements described represented nodes shown figure issues represented green question nodes positions yellow light bulbs pros green signs cons red signs compendium supports node types part core ibis notation nodes can linked ways specified ibis grammar i discuss next ibis elements the ibis grammar can summarized simple rules issues can raised anew can arise issues positions arguments in words ibis element can questioned in compendium notation question node can connect ibis node ideas can respond questions ie compendium light bulb nodes can link question nodes the arrow pointing idea question depicts responds relationship arguments can associated ideas ie compendium nodes can link light bulb nodes arrows pointing latter the legal links summarized figure figure legal links ibis the rules best illustrated example follow links see illustrations ibis action see post one examples ibis mapping dialogue see post one examples argument visualisation issue mapping using ibis the case studies in talk i illustrated use ibis going couple examples detail i described detail articles rather reproduce i will provide links original sources the first example drawn dialogue mapping exercise i data warehousing project a detailed discussion context process mapping along figures map developed available paper entitled mapping project dialogues using ibis case study reflections pdf the second example i described lighthearted example use ibis nonwork setting discussed post what i now bedtime story dialogue mapping benefits ibis the case studies serve highlight ibis encourages collective deliberation issues since issues struggle projects often elements wickedness eliciting opinions group dialogue improves chances arriving solution acceptable group whole additional benefits using ibis group setting include it adds clarity discussion serves simple intuitive discussion summary compare meeting minutes is common point reference move discussion forward it captures logic decision decision rationale further still ibis disarms disruptive discussion tactics death repetition person brings issue million one different ways in situations mapper simply points already captured issue asks person want add anything the disruptive behaviour becomes evident participants including offender the beauty ibis lies simplicity it easy learn four nodes simple grammar moreover participants dont need learn notation i found people can understand whats going within minutes just simple pointers mapper another nice feature ibis methodologyneutral whatever methodological persuasion agile something thats boksed can use address decision problems project meetings getting started the best way learn ibis map logic articles newspapers magazines even professional journals once familiar syntax grammar can graduate oneonone conversations small meetings when using meeting first time tell participants simply taking notes if things start work well ie mapping conversation successfully group will start interacting map using basis reasoning means move dialogue forward once get point want mapping logic conversation of course much ive mentioned check references end piece information mapping dialogues using ibis wrap as post essentially covers talk i gave conference i like wrap couple observations comments audience i began talk line a central myth decision making organisations rational process i thought many audience disagree to surprise however almost unanimous agreement the points i made uncertainty problem wickedness also seemed resonate there great examples audience wicked problems it particularly memorable one infrastructure project one normally think particularly wicked displaying elements wickedness soon started it seems although mainstream management ignores sensemaking aspect profession many practitioners tacitly understand making sense ambiguous situations important part work moreover know best done harnessing collective intelligence group rather enforcing process solution
