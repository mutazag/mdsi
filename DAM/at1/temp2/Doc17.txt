The aim opinion piece writer convince readers particular idea point view reasonable right. Typically, pieces weave facts , interpretations reasoning prose, wherefrom can hard pick essential thread argumentation. In earlier post I showed issue map can help clarifying central arguments "difficult" piece writing mapping Fred Brooks' classic article No Silver Bullet. Note I use word "difficult" article , times, misunderstood misquoted; particularly hard follow. Still, Brooks' article borders academic; arguments presented therein interest relatively small group people within software development community. Most developers architects terribly interested essential difficulties profession   just want get jobs. In present post, I develop issue map piece potentially wider interest IT community   Nicholas Carr's 2003 article, IT Doesn't Matter. The main point Carr's article IT becoming utility, much like electricity, water rail. As trend towards commoditisation gains momentum, strategic advantage offered -house IT will diminish, organisations will better served buying IT services "computing utility" providers maintaining IT shops. Although Carr makes persuasive case, glosses key difference IT utilities (see post ). Despite , many business IT leaders taken words way things will . It therefore important IT professionals understand Carr's arguments. The consequences likely affect time soon, already. Some preliminaries proceeding map. First, complete article available   may want read proceeding ( essential). Second, discussion assumes basic knowledge IBIS (Issue-Based Information System)   see post quick tutorial IBIS. Third, map constructed using open-source tool Compendium can downloaded . With preliminaries way, get issue mapping Carr's article. So, root (.e. central) question Carr poses article? The title piece "IT Doesn't Matter"   one possible root question , "Why IT matter?" But candidates: "On basis IT infrastructural technology?" "Why strategic value IT diminishing?" example. From clear fair degree subjectivity every step constructing issue map. The visual representation I construct one interpretation Carr's argument. Out ( many possibles), I choose "Why IT matter?" root question. Why? Well, view whole point piece convince reader IT matter infrastructural technology consequently strategic significance. This point become clearer development issue map progresses. The ideas respond question immediately obvious. This unusual: I've mentioned elsewhere, points can made sequentially   one   expressed prose. In cases one may read piece entirety figure elements respond root ( ) question. In case hand, response root question stands clearly quick browse article. It : IT infrastructural technology. The map root question response shown Figure 1. Figure 1: Issue Map Stage 1 Figure 1: Issue Map Stage 1 Moving , arguments Carr offer (pros) (cons) idea? A reading article reveals one con four pros. Let's look cons first: IT ( I take mean software) complex malleable, unlike infrastructural technologies. This point mentioned, passing, third page paper: "Although complex malleable predecessors, IT hallmarks infrastructural technology " The arguments supporting idea IT infrastructural technology : The evolution IT closely mirrors infrastructural technologies electricity rail. Although point encompasses points made , I think merits separate mention analogies quite striking. Carr makes persuasive, well-researched case supporting point. IT highly replicable. This point needs elaboration, I think. IT transport mechanism digital information. This true, least far network messaging infrastructure concerned. Cost effectiveness increases IT services shared. This true , providing understood flexibility lost services shared. The map, incorporating pros cons shown Figure 2. Figure 2: Issue Map Stage 2 Figure 2: Issue Map Stage 2 Now arguments notion IT infrastructural technology laid , lets look article , time eye issues (questions) raised. The first question obvious one: What consequences IT infrastructural technology? Another point considered role proprietary technologies,   definition   infrastructural. The holds true custom built applications. So, begs question, IT infrastructural technology, proprietary custom built applications fit ? The map, questions added shown Figure 3. Figure 3: Issue Map Stage 3 Figure 3: Issue Map Stage 3 Let's now look ideas respond two questions. A point Carr makes early article strategic value IT diminishing. This essentially consequence notion IT infrastructural technology. This idea supported following arguments: IT ubiquitous   everywhere, least business world. Everyone uses way. This implies one gets strategic advantage using . What proprietary technologies custom apps?. Carr reckons : Doomed economic obsolescence. This idea supported argument apps expensive hard maintain. Related , will replaced generic apps incorporate best practices. This trend already evident increasing number enterprise type applications offered services. The advantages ) cost little b) can offered web c) spare client painful maintenance headaches. The map incorporating ideas supporting arguments shown Figure 4. Figure 4: Issue Map Stage 4 Figure 4: Issue Map Stage 4 Finally, painting somewhat gloomy picture ( corporate IT minion, ) Carr asks answers question: How organisations deal changing role IT ( strategic operational)? His answers : Reduce IT spend. Buy proven technology   follow lead. Focus (operational) vulnerabilities rather (strategic) opportunities. The map incorporating question ideas respond shown Figure 5, also final map (click graphic view full-sized image). Figure 5: Final Issue Map Figure 5: Issue Map Stage 5 Map completed, I'm essentially done post. Before closing, however, I'd like mention couple general points arise issue mapping prose pieces. Figure 5 interpretation article. I emphasise interpretation may coincide Carr intended convey ( fact, probably ). This highlights important, obvious, point: writer intends convey writing may coincide readers interpret . Even worse, different readers may interpret piece differently. Writers need write awareness potential misunderstood. So, first point issue maps can help writers clarify improve quality reasoning cast prose. Issue maps sketch logical skeleton framework argumentative prose. As , can help highlight weak points arguments. For example, article Carr glosses complexity malleability software. This weak point argument, key difference IT traditional infrastructural technologies. Thus second point issue maps can help readers visualise weak links arguments might obscured rhetoric persuasive writing. To conclude, issue maps valuable writers readers: writers can use issue maps improve quality arguments committing writing, readers can use maps understand arguments thus committed.
