Here's question mind : Why organisations find difficult capture transmit knowledge created projects? I'll attempt answer sorts post point solution sorts   taking bit detour along way, I'm often guilty   Let us first consider knowledge generated projects. In project environments, knowledge typically created response challenge faced. The challenge may project objective , case knowledge created embedded product service design. On hand small part project: say, limitation technology used, case knowledge might correspond workaround discovered project team member. In either case, existence issue challenge precondition creation knowledge. The project team ( subset ) decides issue tackled. They incrementally; exploration, trial error discussion   creating knowledge bargain. In nutshell: knowledge created project members go process discovery. This process may involve entire team ( first example) small subset thereof ( second example, programmer may working alone). In cases, though, aim understand problem, explore potential solutions find "best" one thus creating new knowledge. Now, perspective project organisational learning, project documentation must capture solution process developed. Typically, documentation tends focus former, neglecting latter. This akin presenting solution high school mathematics problem without showing intervening steps. My high school maths teacher 've awarded zero effort regardless whether answer right. And good reason : steps leading solution important solution . Why? Because steps illustrate thought processes reasoning behind solution. So project documentation. Ideally, documentation provide background, constraints, viewpoints, arguments counter-arguments go creation project knowledge. Unfortunately, seldom . Why ? An answer can found farsighted paper, entitled Designing Organizational Memory: Preserving Intellectual Assets Knowledge Economy, published Jeff Conklin 1997. In paper Conklin draws distinction formal informal knowledge; terms correspond end-result process discussed previous paragraph.To quote paper, formal knowledge " stuff books, manuals, documents training courses  primary work product knowledge worker " Conklin notes , "Organisations routinely capture formal knowledge; indeed, rely   without much success   organizational memory." On hand, informal knowledge , " knowledge created used process creating formal results It includes ideas, facts, assumptions, meanings, questions, decisions, guesses, stories points view. It important work knowledge worker formal knowledge , ephemeral transitory " As consequence, informal knowledge elusive; rarely makes documents. Dr. Conklin lists two reasons organisations ( includes temporary organisations projects) fail capture informal knowledge. These : Business culture values results process. In words, "One reason widespread failure capture informal knowledge Western culture come value results   output work process   far process , emphasise things relationships." The tools knowledge workers support process knowledge work   , tools focus capturing formal knowledge ( end result knowledge work) rather informal knowledge ( end result achieved   "steps" solution, speak). The key creating useful documentation thus lies capturing informal knowledge. In order , elusive form knowledge must first made explicit   .e. expressible words pictures. Here's notion shared understanding, discussed previous post comes play. To quote Conklin's paper, "One element creating shared understanding making informal knowledge explicit. This means surfacing key ideas, facts, assumptions, meanings, questions, decisions, guesses, stories, points view. It means capturing organizing informal knowledge everyone access . It means changing process knowledge work focus creating managing shared display group's informal thinking learning. The shared display transparent vehicle making informal knowledge explicit." The notion shared display central technique dialogue mapping, group facilitation technique can help diverse group achieve shared understanding problem. Dialogue mapping uses visual notation called IBIS (short Issue Based Information System) capture issues, ideas arguments come meeting (see previous post quick introduction dialogue mapping crash-course IBIS). As far knowledge capture concerned, I see two distinct uses IBIS . They : As Conklin suggests, IBIS maps can used surface capture informal knowledge real-time, generated discussion two people. It can also used situations one person researches finds solution challenge. In case person use IBIS capture background, approaches tried, pros cons   .e. process solution arrived . This, together formal stuff   project organisations capture adequately   result documents provide complete view knowledge generated projects. Now, previous post (linked ) I discussed example dialogue mapping used real-life project challenge: best implement near real-time updates finance data mart. The final issue map, constructed using mapping tool called Compendium, reproduced : Final Map Example Issue Map The map captures decisions made, also options discussed arguments options. As , captures decision along context, process rationale behind . In words, captures formal informal knowledge pertaining decision. In simple case, IBIS succeeded making informal knowledge explicit. Project teams line can understand decision made, technical business perspective. It worth noting Compendium maps can reference external documents via Reference Nodes, , though less important argumentation, extremely useful documentation. Here illustration references external documents can inserted IBIS map reference node: Links external docs Links external docs As illustrated, feature can used link range external documents   clicking reference node map ( image !) opens external document. Exploiting , project document can operate two levels: first IBIS map depicts relationships issues, ideas arguments, second supporting documents provide details specific nodes relationships. Much informal knowledge pertaining issue resides first level   .e. relationships nodes   knowledge made explicit map. To conclude, perhaps worth summarising main points post. Projects generate new knowledge process issues ideas proposed, explored trialled. Typically, project documentation captures outcome (formal knowledge), neglecting much context, background process discovery (informal knowledge). IBIS maps offer possibility capturing aspects knowledge, resulting greatly improved project ( hence organisational) memory.
