A central myth decision making organisations rational process. The qualifier rational refers decision-making methods based following broad steps: Identify available options. Develop criteria rating options. Rate options according criteria developed. Select top-ranked option. The truth decision making organisations generally follow process. As I pointed post ( based article Tim van Gelder) decisions often based mix informal reasoning, personal beliefs even leaps faith. . Quoting post, formal ( rational) processes often applied one following reasons: Real-world options often quantified rated meaningful way. Many life's dilemmas fall category. For example, decision accept decline job offer rarely made basis material gain alone. Even ratings possible, can highly subjective. For example, considering job offer, one candidate may give importance financial matters whereas another might consider lifestyle-related matters (flexi-hours, commuting distance etc.) paramount. Another complication may enough information settle matter conclusively. As example, investment decisions often made basis quantitative information based questionable assumptions. Finally, problem may wicked   .e. complex, multi-faceted difficult analyse using formal decision making methods. Classic examples wicked problems climate change ( much , say even problem) city / town planning. Such problems forced formal decision analysis frameworks meaningful way. The main theme running uncertainty. Most decisions called upon make professional lives fraught uncertainty   makes hard rate options, adds subjectivity ratings ( possible) magnifies wickedness issue. Decision making projects need systematic deliberation The important decisions project generally made start, sometimes called "front-end projects". Unfortunately information availability lowest , consequently, uncertainty highest. In situations, decision makers feel left little choice base decisions instinct intuition. Now, even one bases decision intuition, deliberation involved   one thinks things weighs options qualitative way. Unfortunately, situations, done unsystematic manner. Moreover, decision makers fail record informal reasoning behind decisions. As result rationale behind decisions made remain opaque want understand particular choices made. A brief introduction IBIS Clearly, one needs means make informal reasoning behind decision explicit. Now number argument visualisation techniques available purpose, I will focus one I worked : Issue-Based Information System (IBIS). I will introduce notation briefly . Those want detailed introduction will find one article entitled, The whence issue-based information systems. IBIS consists three main elements: Issues ( questions): issues need addressed. Positions ( ideas): responses questions. Typically set ideas respond issue represents spectrum perspectives issue. Arguments: can Pros (arguments supporting) Cons (arguments ) issue. The complete set arguments respond idea represents multiplicity viewpoints . The best IBIS mapping tool Compendium   can downloaded . In Compendium, IBIS elements described represented nodes shown Figure 1: issues represented green question nodes; positions yellow light bulbs; pros green + signs cons red   signs. Compendium supports node types, part core IBIS notation. Nodes can linked ways specified IBIS grammar I discuss next. IBIS Elements The IBIS grammar can summarized simple rules: Issues can raised anew can arise issues, positions arguments. In words, IBIS element can questioned. In Compendium notation: question node can connect IBIS node. Ideas can respond questions   .e. Compendium "light bulb" nodes can link question nodes. The arrow pointing idea question depicts "responds " relationship. Arguments can associated ideas   .e Compendium +   nodes can link "light bulb" nodes ( arrows pointing latter) The legal links summarized Figure 2 . Figure 2: Legal Links IBIS The rules best illustrated example- follow links see illustrations IBIS action: See post one examples IBIS mapping dialogue. See post one examples argument visualisation (issue mapping) using IBIS. The case studies In talk, I illustrated use IBIS going couple examples detail, I described detail articles. Rather reproduce , I will provide links original sources . The first example drawn dialogue mapping exercise I data warehousing project. A detailed discussion context process mapping (along figures map developed) available paper entitled, Mapping project dialogues using IBIS   case study reflections (PDF). The second example, I described light-hearted example use IBIS non-work setting, discussed post, What I now   bedtime story dialogue mapping. Benefits IBIS The case studies serve highlight IBIS encourages collective deliberation issues. Since issues struggle projects often elements wickedness, eliciting opinions group dialogue improves chances arriving "solution" acceptable group whole. Additional benefits using IBIS group setting include: It adds clarity discussion Serves simple intuitive discussion summary (compare meeting minutes!) Is common point reference move discussion forward. It captures logic decision (decision rationale) Further still, IBIS disarms disruptive discussion tactics "death repetition"   person brings issue million one different ways. In situations mapper simply points already captured issue asks person want add anything . The disruptive behaviour becomes evident participants (including offender). The beauty IBIS lies simplicity. It easy learn   four nodes simple grammar. Moreover, participants need learn notation. I found people can understand going within minutes just simple pointers mapper. Another nice feature IBIS methodology-neutral. Whatever methodological persuasion   Agile something BOKsed   can use address decision problems project meetings. Getting started The best way learn IBIS map logic articles newspapers, magazines even professional journals. Once familiar syntax grammar, can graduate one--one conversations, small meetings. When using meeting first time, tell participants simply taking notes. If things start work well   .e. mapping conversation successfully   group will start interacting map, using basis reasoning means move dialogue forward. Once get point, want   mapping logic conversation. Of course, much I've mentioned . Check references end piece information mapping dialogues using IBIS. Wrap As post essentially covers talk I gave conference, I like wrap couple observations comments audience. I began talk line, "A central myth decision making organisations rational process." I thought many audience disagree. To surprise, however, almost unanimous agreement! The points I made uncertainty problem wickedness also seemed resonate. There great examples audience wicked problems IT   particularly memorable one infrastructure project ( one normally think particularly wicked) displaying elements wickedness soon started. It seems although mainstream management ignores sense-making aspect profession, many practitioners tacitly understand making sense ambiguous situations important part work. Moreover, know best done harnessing collective intelligence group rather enforcing process solution
