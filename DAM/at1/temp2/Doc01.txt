In practice risk management rational, means-end based process: risks identified, analysed solved ( mitigated). Although steps seem objective, involves human perceptions, biases interests. Where Jill sees opportunity, Jack may see risks. Indeed, problem differences stakeholder perceptions broader risk analysis. The recognition differences world-views may irreconcilable led Horst Rittel coin now well-known term, wicked problem. These problems tend made complex interconnected interdependent issues makes difficult tackle using standard rational- analytical methods problem solving. Most high-stakes risks organisations face elements wickedness   indeed significant organisational change fraught risk. Murphy rules; things can go wrong, often . The current paradigm risk management, focuses analyzing quantifying risks using rational methods, broad enough account wicked aspects risk. I thinking I stumbled fascinating paper Robin Holt entitled, Risk Management: The Talking Cure, outlines possible approach analysing interconnected risks. In brief, Holt draws parallel psychoanalysis ( means tackle individual anxiety) risk management ( means tackle organizational anxiety). In post, I present extensive discussion interpretation Holt s paper. Although philosophy risk management practice, I found paper interesting, relevant thought provoking. My hope readers might find . Background Holt begins noting modern life characterized uncertainty. Paradoxically, technological progress increased sense control surroundings lives actually heightened personal feelings uncertainty. Moreover, sense uncertainty allayed rational analysis. On contrary, may even increased , example, drawing attention risks may otherwise remained unaware . Risk thus becomes lens perceive world. The danger can paralyze. As Holt puts ,  risk becomes backdrop perceiving world perception collapses self-inhibition, thereby compounding uncertainty inertia. Most individuals know experience: us one time another frozen inaction perceived risks. We also know deep personal level standard responses risk inadequate many worries tend inchoate therefore can neither coherently articulated analysed. In Holt s words: ..People recognize [risk] perspective breakdown rational calculations alone, threats forms life   non-calculative way see world. [Mainstream risk analysis] remains caught thrall expert presumptions, denigrating lay knowledge perceptions grounds codified institutionally expressed. Holt suggests risk management account codified, uncodified uncodifiable aspects uncertainty organizational perspective. This entails mode analysis takes account different, even conflicting, perspectives non-judgemental way. In essence, suggests talking means increase awareness contingent nature risks rather means definitively resolving . Shortcomings risk analysis The basic aim risk analysis ( practiced) contain uncertainty within set bounds determined organisation s risk appetite. As mentioned earlier, process begins identifying classifying risks. Once done, one determines probability impact risk. Then, based priorities resources available ( determined organisation s risk appetite) one develops strategies mitigate risks significant organisation s perspective. However, messiness organizational life makes difficult see risk clear-cut way. We may pretend rational , reality perceive lens background, interests , experiences. Based perceptions rationalize action ( inaction!) simply get life. As Holt writes: The concept [ risk] refers   mélange experience, managers accept contingencies without overwhelmed point complete passivity confusion, Managers learn recognize differences things, acknowledge limits. Only way can managers said make judgements, seen involved something called future. Then, memorable line, goes say: The future, however, lasts long time, much make containment prediction often futile exercise. Although one may well argue case many organizational risks, undeniable certain mitigation strategies ( example, accepting risks turn significant later) may significant consequences --near future. Advice politician-scholar So can one address slippery aspects risk   things people sense intuitively, find difficult articulate? Taking inspiration Machiavelli, Holt suggests reframing risk management means determine wise actions face contradictory forces fortune necessity. As Holt puts : Necessity describes forces unbreachable manageable acceptance containment—acts God, tendencies species, . In recognizing inevitability, [one can retain one s] position, enhancing extent others fail recognize necessity. Far influential, often confused necessity, fortune. Fortune elusive approachable. Fortune never relied upon: The greatest good fortune always least trusted ; good often kept underfoot ridiculous elevated, provides [one] opportunity. Wise actions involve resolve cunning ( I interpret political nous). This entails understanding complete ( even partial) control events may occur future. The future largely unknowable people s true drives motivations. Yet, despite , managers must act. This requires personal determination together deep understanding social political aspects one s environment. And little later,  risk management clear conception problem coupled modes rankable resolutions, limited process, judgemental analysis limited vicissitudes budgets, programmes, personalities contested priorities. In short: risk management practice tends far way portrayed textbooks professional literature. The wickedness risk management Most managers work supervision schooled rational-scientific approach problem solving. It surprise, therefore, use manage risks: gather analyse information potential risks, formulate potential solutions ( mitigation strategies) implement best one (according predetermined criteria). However, method works problems straightforward tame, rather wicked. Many issues risk managers confronted wicked, messy . Often though, problems treated tame. Reducing wicked messy problem one amenable rational analysis invariably entails overlooking views certain stakeholder groups , worse, ignoring key aspects problem. This may work short term, will exacerbate problem longer run. Holt illustrates point follows: A primary danger mistaking mess tame problem becomes even difficult deal mess. Blaming operator error mishap production line introducing added surveillance illustration mess mistaken tame problem. An operator easily isolated identifiable, whereas technological system process embedded, unwieldy , initially, far costly alter. Blaming operators politically expedient. It might also managers administrators know think terms messes; learned sort complex socio-technical systems. It important note although many risk management practitioners recognize essential wickedness issues deal , practice risk management quite task dealing matters. One step towards develop shared (enterprise-wide) understanding risks soliciting input diverse stakeholders groups, may hold opposing views. The skills required different analytical techniques focus problem solving decision making techniques taught colleges business schools. Analysis replaced sensemaking   collaborative process harnesses wisdom group arrive collective understanding problem thence common commitment course action. This necessarily involves skills appear lexicon rational problem solving: negotiation, facilitation, rhetoric ilk dismissed relevance scientifically oriented analyst. In end though, even may enough: different stakeholders may perceive given risk wildly different ways, much consensus can reached. The problem current framework risk management requires analyst perform objective analysis situation/problem, even situations possible. To get around Holt suggests may useful see risk management way encounter problems rather analyse solve . What mean? He sees forum people can talk risks openly: To enable organizational members encounter problems, risk management s repertoire activity needs engage human components: belief, perception, enthusiasm fear. This gets root problem: risk matters increases anxiety generally affects peoples sense wellbeing. Given , surprise Holt s proposed solution draws psychoanalysis. The analogy psychoanalysis risk management Any discussion psychoanalysis  especially one intended audience largely schooled rational/scientific methods analysis   must begin acknowledgement claims psychoanalysis tested. That , since psychoanalysis speaks unobservable objects ego unconscious, claims makes concepts proven falsified. However Holt suggests, exactly makes good fit encountering ( opposed analyzing) risks. In words: It precisely psychoanalysis avoids overarching claim produce testable, watertight, universal theories relevance risk management. By avoiding universal theories formulas, risk management can afford deviate pronouncements using mathematical formulas cover immanent indeterminables manifest human perception awareness systems integration. His point clear parallel psychoanalysis individual, risk management organisation: We understand according template according peculiar, beguiling histories. Metaphorically, risk management can make explicit similar realization within organizations. The revealing unconscious world constant state tension excess stricture, knowledge ignorance, emblematic organizational members encountering messes, wicked problems wicked messes can forced think. In brief, Holt suggests psychoanalysis individual, risk management organisation. Talking   importance conversations A key element psychoanalysis conversation analyst patient. Through process, analyst attempts get patient become aware hidden fears motivations. As Holt puts , Psychoanalysis occupies point rupture conscious intention unconscious desire — revealing repressed overdetermined aspects self-organization manifest various expressions anxiety, humour, And , little later, makes connection organisations: The fact organizations emerge contingent, complex interdependencies specific narrative histories suggests risk management able use similar conversations psychoanalysis investigate hidden motives, examine  possible reception initiatives strategies perspective inherently divergent stakeholders, analyse motives expectations risk management . This fundamentally reorients perspective risk management facing apparent uncertainties using technical assessment tools, using conversations devoid fixed formulas encounter questioned identities, indeterminate destinies, multiple conflicting aims myriad anxieties. Through conversations involving groups stakeholders different risk perceptions, one might able get better understanding particular risk hence, may , design effective mitigation strategy. More importantly, one may even realise certain risks risks others seem straightforward implications remained hidden conversation. These collective conversations take place workshops    tackle problems wicked messes, avoid lowest-denominator consensus favour continued discovery alternatives conversation, instructed metaphor rather technical taxonomy, risk management better able appreciate everyday ambivalence fundamentally influences late-modern organizational activity. As , risk management merely rationalization uncertain experience structured contested activity involving multiple stakeholders engaged perpetual translation within environments operation complexes aims. As facilitator workshops, risk analyst provokes stakeholders think feelings motivations may bounds standard risk analysis workshop. Such paradigm goes well beyond mainstream risk management addresses risk-related anxieties fears individuals affected . Conclusion This brings end --short summary Holt s paper. Given length post, I reckon I keep closing remarks short. So I ll leave paraphrasing last line paper, summarises main message: risk management developing organizational capacity overcoming risks, freed presumption absolute control.
