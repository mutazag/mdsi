Most approaches project risk management prescribe structured approach managing risks involving steps identification, analysis response planning (see PMBOK Guide, example). Implicit approach assumption risks exist " " can identified via systematic investigation. Among things, leads view possible   indeed, desirable   identify possible risks project, manage lifecycle project. Of course, new risks may emerge, underlying belief can identified managed using structured approach. In short, fundamental assumption risks objective existence can therefore identified examination project environment. In paper entitled, The Limits Risk Management   A Social Construction Approach, Bernd Stahl co-authors argue traditional view risk management limited : The assumption objectivity leads false sense security. It (often) ignores ( understates) risks may specific certain organisations situations. Consequently, suggest may fruitful view risks social constructs   perceptions reality products social interactions stakeholders. In post I explore somewhat unusual view risk. I'll first illustrate general idea risk social construct describe common IS project risks can seen social constructs. I'll end brief look implications project risk management. Project risks social constructs The first step classical ( standard) risk analysis identify possible events may affect project. However , principle, impossible general method . Consequently, risk managers usually compile lists potential risks (based prior experience, research literature, textbooks, brainstorming etc.) use starting points analysis. The point , methods ad-hoc , despite claims contrary, guarantee comprehensive coverage risks. This point made clearly paper Lyytinen et. al. examines four techniques software project risk analysis concludes substantial differences . Quoting conclusion Lyytinen paper:  practitioners cautious regard expected miracles risk management approach. Risk management approaches neither complete risk-proof ( italics). Their value context managing complex socio-technical change put high premium shaping management attention learning new organizing schemes help make sense development situations new ways  According Stahl, conclusions Lyytinnen ( researchers) support idea risk s social construct comes result interactions agreements involved project ( individual perceptions ): We believe [] objective concept risk flawed threatens success entire enterprise. A concept objective risk raises expectation risks can completely controlled. Also, suggests comprehensive list risks compiled, end theoretical work reached managerial practice can take . These factors can combine create false sense security will dull managers' attention can thereby create even bigger risks. We hold risk social construction depending social agreements individual perceptions. It must ascribed become real. In opinion big leap logic paragraph: I see " expectation risk can completely controlled" "false sense security creates" implies risk construct depends "social agreements individual perceptions." Nevertheless, I believe social constructionist view risk useful project risks social dimension. I'll elaborate point via examples next section. IS project risk social construct   examples Most research literature social construction tends hard read devoid examples professional project managers can relate . This shame much work casts critical eye implicit assumptions underlie project management practice. So, instead quoting paraphrasing hard--read papers, I'll illustrate common project risks social dimension. The risks I consider drawn paper entitled, Early warning signs IT project failure: dominant dozen, Leon Kappelman co workers. The paper presents top twelve early-stage project risks based analysis data gathered project professionals survey research literature. I'll discuss four risks Kappelman's dominant dozen social origins. Lack top management support According Kappelman et. al. number one risk IS projects. The point risk often arises (dysfunctional) politicking managers. As Kappelman et. al. state : In many cases, IT projects get caught enterprise politics fundamental disagreements overall enterprise priorities. In cases resources enterprise-wide commitment required success lacking. Middle managers see project important enterprise performance evaluations therefore redirect resources attention activities top management support. The point : risk often consequence corporate politics, much social construct. Lack stakeholder involvement / participation The following passage paper highlights socially constructed nature risk: If key project stakeholders participate major review meetings, signals engaged project therefore project high priority . Other stakeholders soon begin disengage . The project manager finds harder get participation resources necessary project success, especially full-time members project team. Often project team members get reassigned projects perceived important. The point   key stakeholders, influence organisation, can cause project go awry. Another common situation one stakeholders lose interest project see benefits involved. This point well-recognised traditional risk management highlights importance getting stakeholder buy-. The point risk consequence individual perceptions, objective reality. In words, social construct. Lack documented requirements / success criteria This risk old classic, discussed analysed several well-known writers. As Robert Glass mentions book facts fallacies software engineering: This problem caused fact customers users software solution really sure problem need solved. They may think know outset, discover project proceeds problem wanted solve simplistic unrealistic something else expecting. Or may really know anything outset simply exploring solutions vague problem know needs solved . Regardless causes outcome, point Ill defined scope means different stakeholders different interpretations delivered. Consequently, project objectives become matter interpretation opinion. This shows even something basic project objectives actually social constructs   depend individual stakeholder perceptions. Seen light stretch say can many objectives stakeholders! Communication breakdown among stakeholders This risk perhaps obvious social construct   communication lifeblood project, also basis professional social relationships built. Communication becomes important projects environments diverse stakeholders ongoing change norm. As Kappelman et. al. state: Any significant project multiple stakeholders requires ongoing choreography various tasks resources. Change life project inevitable — business environment, competitor strategic tactical moves, laws regulations, management team, staff turnover, resource availability, cost — name just possibilities. If stakeholders communicate work together ongoing basis, project team will pulled multiple directions  Communication breakdowns can occur variety reasons, arise conflicting viewpoints involved. As I written post project communication, "A shared world-view   includes common understanding tools, terminology, culture, politics etc.   enables effective communication within group." Implications The examples show common project risks social dimension, even entirely social constructs. The social aspects risk often ignored hard handle   much easier follow process deal stakeholders ( might get) upset. Consequently risks communication breakdown lack management support broached high cost speaking . I contend many project risks remain unaddressed . The implications social constructionist view risk can summed follows: It impossible, principle, compile authoritative lists possible risks. Risks studied context particular project environment. This includes technical, social organizational aspects environment. Particular emphasis given relationships stakeholders may present barriers honest assessment risks. These implications suggest participatory approach involving open deliberation mandatory successful risk management. As Stahl et. al. put : Indeed, checklist risks just starting point ongoing debate risk. Management identify stakeholder risky decisions engage free discourse nature evaluation risks. The stakeholder discourse used define responsibilities . The stakeholders parties interested process presumably best suited identify risk factors. Ideally process lead consensus concerning risks. Similar approaches suggested literature, however, wish emphasise managers understand risk social construct will complex costly process stakeholder discourses way dealing risk make sense ( italics). Summing The mathematical analytical machinery risk management can obscure fact managing risks much art science, calling skills dealing people well probabilities. Organisational politics, individual perceptions interactions different stakeholder groups play role creating risks. In words, risks objective entities, social dimension.
