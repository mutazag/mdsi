Issue Based Information System (IBIS) notation invented Horst Rittel Werner Kunz early 1970s. IBIS best known use dialogue mapping, collaborative approach tackling wicked problems (.e. contentious issues) organisations. It range applications well   capturing knowledge good example, I'll much say later post. Over last five years , I written fair bit IBIS blog book I co-authored dialogue mapping expert, Paul Culmsee. The present post reprises article I wrote five years ago "" "whence" notation: practical aspects   notation, grammar etc -, well origins, advantages limitations. My motivations revisiting piece revise update original discussion , important, cover recent developments IBIS technology open interesting possibilities area knowledge management. To appreciate power IBIS, best begin understanding context notation invented. I'll therefore start discussion origins notation followed introduction . Finally, I'll cover development last 40 odd years, focusing recent developments I mentioned . Wicked origins A good place start started. IBIS first described paper entitled, Issues elements Information Systems; written Horst Rittel ( man coined term wicked problem) Werner Kunz July 1970. They state intent behind IBIS first line abstract paper: Issue-Based Information Systems (IBIS) meant support coordination planning political decision processes. IBIS guides identification, structuring, settling issues raised problem-solving groups, provides information pertinent discourse. Rittel's preoccupation area public policy planning   also context defined term wicked problem originally. Given background surprise Rittel Kunz foresaw IBIS :  type information system meant support work cooperatives like governmental administrative agencies committees, planning groups, etc., confronted problem complex order arrive plan decision  The problems tackled cooperatives paradigm-defining examples wicked problems. From start, , IBIS intended tool facilitate collaborative approach solving  better, managing wicked problem helping develop shared perspective . A brief introduction IBIS The IBIS notation consists following three elements: Issues( questions): issues debated. Typically, issues framed questions lines "What X?" X issue interest group. For example, case group executives, X might rapidly changing market condition whereas case group IT people, X ageing system hard replace. Ideas( positions): responses questions. For example, one ideas offered IT group might replace said system newer one. Typically whole set ideas respond issue discussion represents spectrum participant perspectives issue. Arguments: can Pros (arguments ) Cons (arguments ) issue. The complete set arguments respond idea represents multiplicity viewpoints . Compendium freeware tool can used create IBIS maps  can downloaded . In Compendium, IBIS elements described represented nodes shown Figure 1: issues represented blue-green question marks; positions yellow light bulbs; pros green + signs cons red   signs. Compendium supports node types, part core IBIS notation. Nodes can linked ways specified IBIS grammar I discuss next. Figure 1: IBIS elements Figure 1: IBIS elements The IBIS grammar can summarized three simple rules: Issues can raised anew can arise issues, positions arguments. In words, IBIS element can questioned. In Compendium notation: question node can connect IBIS node. Ideas can respond questions  .e. Compendium "light bulb" nodes can link question nodes. The arrow pointing idea question depicts "responds " relationship. Arguments can associated ideas  .e. Compendium "+" " " nodes can link "light bulb" nodes ( arrows pointing latter) The legal links summarized Figure 2 . Figure 2: Legal links IBIS Figure 2: Legal links IBIS Yes, simple . The rules best illustrated example- follow links see illustrations IBIS action: See postfor simple example dialogue mapping. See postor one examples argument visualisation. (Note: using IBIS map structure written arguments called issue mapping. See one example Paul children. This example also features book. made appearance book. Now know IBIS works seen examples action, time trace history notation early days present. Operation early systems When Rittel Kunz wrote paper, three IBIS-type systems operation: two government agencies ( US, one presumes) one university environment (quite possibly Berkeley, Rittel worked). Although seems quaint old-fashioned now, surprise manual, paper-based systems; effort expense involved computerizing systems early 70s prohibitive pay- questionable. The Rittel-Kunz paper introduced earlier also offers short description early IBIS systems operated: An initially unstructured problem area topic denotes task named "trigger phrase" ("Urban Renewal Baltimore," "The War," "Tax Reform"). About topic subtopics discourse develops. Issues brought disputed different positions (Rittel's word ideas responses) assumed. Arguments constructed defense different positions issue settled convincing opponents decided formal decision procedure. Frequently questions fact directed experts fed documentation system. Answers obtained can questioned turned issues. Through counterplay questioning arguing, participants form exert judgments incessantly, developing structured pictures problem solutions. It possible separate "understanding problem" phase "information" "solution" since every formulation problem also statement potential solution. Even today, forty years later, excellent description IBIS used facilitate common understanding complex problems. Moreover, process reaching shared understanding (whether using IBIS ) one key ways knowledge created within organizations. To foreshadow point I will elaborate later, using IBIS capture key issues, ideas arguments, connections , results navigable map knowledge generated discussion. Fast forward couple decades ( !) In paper published 1988 entitled, gIBIS: A hypertext tool exploratory policy discussion, Conklin Begeman describe prototype graphical, hypertext-based IBIS-type system (called gIBIS) use capturing design rationale (yes, despite title paper, capturing design rationale policy discussions). The development gIBIS represents key step original Rittel-Kunz version IBIS recent version implemented Compendium. Amongst things, IBIS finally paper disk, opening world new possibilities. gIBIS aimed offer users: The ability capture design rationale   options discussed (including ones rejected) discussion around pros cons . A platform promoting computer-mediated collaborativedesign work   ideally situations participants located sites remote . The ability store large amount information able navigate intuitive way. The gIBIS prototype proved successful enough catalyse development Questmap, commercially available software tool supported IBIS. In recent conversation Jeff Conklin mentioned Questmap one earliest Windows-based groupware tools available market  won best--show award category. It interesting note contrast Questmap ( longer exists), Compendium single-user, desktop software. The primary application Questmap area sensemaking helping groups reach collective understanding complex situations might otherwise lead tense adversarial conditions. Indeed, precisely Rittel Kunz intended IBIS used. The key advantage offered computerized IBIS systems one map dialogues real-time, map representing points raised conversation along logical connections. This proved big step forward use IBIS help groups achieve shared understanding complex issues. That said, although notable early successes real-time use IBIS industry environments (see paper, example), accompanied widespread adoption technique. It worth exploring reasons briefly. The tacitness IBIS mastery The reasons lack traction IBIS-type techniques real-time knowledge capture discussed paper Shum et. al. entitled, Hypermedia Support Argumentation-Based Rationale: 15 Years gIBIS QOC. The reasons give : For acceptance, system must offer immediate value person using . Quoting paper, "No designer can expected altruistically enter quality design rationale solely possible benefit possibly unknown person unknown point future unknown task. There must immediate value." Such immediate value obvious novice users IBIS-type systems. There effort involved gaining fluency use IBIS-based software tools. It users can gain appreciation value tools overcoming limitations mapping design arguments paper, whiteboards etc. While rules IBIS simple grasp, intellectual effort   cognitive overhead using IBIS real time involves: Teasing issues, ideas arguments dialogue. Classifying points raised issues, ideas arguments. Naming ( describing) point succinctly. Relating ( linking) point existing map ( anticipating will fit later) Developing sense conversational patterns. Expertise skills can developed sustained practice, surprise beginners find hard use IBIS map dialogues. Indeed, use IBIS real-time conversation mapping tacit skill, much like riding bike swimming   can mastered . Making sense IBIS Despite difficulties mastering IBIS, easy see offers considerable advantages conventional methods documenting discussions. Indeed, Rittel Kunz well aware . Their paper contains nice summary advantages, I paraphrase : IBIS can bridge gap discussions records discussions (minutes, audio/video transcriptions etc.). IBIS sits two, acting short-term memory. The paper thus foreshadows use issue-based systems aid organizational project memory. Many elements (issues, ideas arguments) come discussion contextual meanings different pre-existing definitions. That , interpretation points made questions raised depends circumstances surrounding discussion. What important contextual meaning important formal meaning. IBIS captures former clear way   example response question "What mean X?" elicits meaning X context discussion, subsequently captured idea (position)". I'll much say towards end article. The reasoning used discussions made transparent, supporting ( opposing) evidence. The state argument (discussion) time can inferred glance (unlike case written records). See post advantages visual documentation prose. Often times happens commonality issues , similar issues might important precise meaning. To quote paper, "  description subject matter terms librarians documentalists (sic) may less significant similarity issue issues dealt previously information used treatment " This less issue now search technologies. However, search technologies still largely based keywords rather context. A properly structured, context-searchable IBIS-based archive useful conventional document-based system. As I'll discuss next section, technology now available. To sum , : although IBIS offers means map arguments lacking ability make maps available searchable across organization. IBIS enterprise It interesting note Compendium, unlike predecessor, Questmap, single-user, desktop tool   , , enable sharing maps across enterprise. To sure, possible work around limitation workarounds somewhat clunky. A recent advance IBIS technology addresses issue rather elegantly: Seven Sigma, Australian consultancy founded Paul Culmsee, Chris Tomich Peter Chow, developed Glyma (pronounced "glimmer"): product makes IBIS available collaboration platforms like Microsoft SharePoint. This game-changer enables sharing searching IBIS maps across enterprise. Moreover, shall see , implications go beyond sharing search. Full Disclosure: As regular readers blog know, Paul good friend jointly written book papers. However, time writing, I commercial association Seven Sigma. My comments based playing beta version product Paul kind enough give access well discussions I . Figure 3: IBIS Glyma Figure 3: IBIS Glyma (Click see larger picture) The look feel Glyma much Compendium (see Fig 3 )   keystrokes shortcuts quite similar. I trialled Glyma weeks feel overall experience actually bit better Compendium. For example one can navigate series maps sub-maps using breadcrumb trail. Another example: documents videos embedded within map   one need leave map order view tagged media (unless course one wants see higher resolution). I go detail product features etc. since kind information best accessed source   .e. product website documentation. Instead, I will now focus Glyma addresses longstanding gap knowledge management systems. Revisiting problem context In organisations, knowledge artefacts ( documents audio-visual media) stored hierarchical relational structures ( example, folder within directory structure relational database). To sure, stored artefacts often tagged metadata indicating , created, experience tells metadata useful . The problem context artefact created typically captured. Anyone read document wondered, "What earth authors thinking wrote ?" encountered problem missing context. Context, though hard capture, critically important understanding content knowledge artefact. Any artefact, accessed without appreciation context created liable misinterpreted partially understood. Capturing context enterprise Glyma addresses issue context rather elegantly level enterprise. I'll illustrate point inspiring case study innovative use SharePoint education Paul written time ago. The case study Here backstory Paul's words: Earlier year, I met Louis Zulli Jnr   teacher Florida part program called Centre Advanced Technologies. We co-keynoting conference came I droned common SharePoint governance mistakes The majority Lou's presentation showcased whole bunch SharePoint powered solutions students written. The solutions impressive We treated examples like: IOS, Android Windows Phone apps leveraged SharePoint display teacher's assignments, school events class times; Silverlight based application providing virtual tour campus; Integration SharePoint Moodle ( open source learning platform) An Academic Planner web application allowing students plan classes, submit schedule, reviewed, track credits classes selected whether student's selections meet graduation requirements; All developed 16 18 year olds level quality I know SharePoint consultancies jealous   Although examples highlighted Louis impressive, Paul found interesting anecdotes Lou related dedication persistence students displayed work. Quoting Paul, So demos impressive enough, actually impressed . In fact, hooked slide deck. It anecdotes Lou told dedication students task went getting things done. He spoke students working various school breaks get projects completed leveraged 's various skills strengths. Lou's final slide summed talk brilliantly: Students want make difference! Give right project incredible things. Make project meaningful. Let serve purpose campus community. Learn listen. If students better way, . If idea, let explore . Invest success early. Make sure infrastructure guarantee uptime development farm. Every situation different harm failure. "I failed. I've found 10,000 ways work"   Thomas A. Edison In brief: points highlight fact Lou's primary role director center create conditions make possible students great work. The commercial-level quality work turned students suggests Lou's knowledge build high-performing teams definitely worth capturing. The question : best way (short getting visit talk experiences)? Seeing forest trees Paul recently interviewed Lou intent documenting Lou's experiences. The conversation recorded video "Glymafied"   .e video mapped using IBIS (see Figure 4 ). Figure 4: Knowledge capture via Glyma Figure 4: Knowledge capture via Glyma (Click see larger picture) There points worth noting : The content entire conversation mapped one can "see" conversation glance. The context particular point (.e. content node) made clarified connections node neighbours. Moving left node gives higher level picture, moving right drills details. Of course, reader will noted core IBIS capabilities available Compendium ( IBIS tool). Glyma offers much . Consider following: Relevant documents audio visual media can tagged specific nodes provide supplementary material. In case video recording tagged specific nodes related points made video. Clicking play icon attached node plays segment content node discussed. This really nice feature saves user watch whole video ( play extended game ffwd-rew get point interest). Moreover, provides additional context ( ) captured map. For example, one can attach papers, links web pages, Slideshare presentations etc. fill background context. Glyma integrated enterprise content management system design. One can therefore link map video content powerful built- search content aggregation features systems. For example, users able enter search intranet home page retrieve traditional content documents, also stories, reflections anecdotes experts Lou. Another critical aspect intranet integration ability provide maps contextual navigation. Amazon's ability sell books people never intended buy example power navigation. The ability execute kinds queries outlined previous point, along contextual information user profile details, previous activity intranet area intranet user browsing, makes possible present recommendations nodes maps may potential interest users. Such targeted recommendations might encourage users explore video ( rich media) content. Technical Aside: An interesting --hood feature Glyma uses implementation hypergraph database store maps. (Note: database can store representations graphs (maps) edge can connect 2 vertices). These databases enable storing general graph structures. What means Glyma can extended store kind map (Mind Maps, Concept Maps, Argument Maps whatever)  nodes can shared across maps. This feature developed yet, I mention offers exciting possibilities future. To summarise: since Glyma stores data enterprise-class database, maps can made available across organization. It offers ability tag nodes pretty much kind media (documents, audio/video clips etc.), one can tag specific parts media relevant content node ( snippet video, example). Moreover, sophisticated search capabilities platform enable context aware search. Specifically, can search nodes keywords tags, node interest located, can also view map(s) appears. The map(s) inform us context(s) relating node. The ability display "contextual environment" piece information makes Glyma really interesting. In metaphorical terms, Glyma enables us see forest trees.   , conclude My aim post introduce readers IBIS notation trace history origins issue mapping recent developments knowledge management. The history technique valuable gives insight rationale behind creation, leads better understanding different ways can used. Indeed, exaggeration say knowledge management applications discussed extension Rittel's original reasons inventing IBIS. I like close piece couple observations experience IBIS: Firstly, real surprise technique can capture written arguments conversations, despite three distinct elements simple grammar. Yes, require thought , particularly mapping discussions real time. However, cognitive overhead good forces mapper think said instead just writing blind. Thoughtful transcription aim game. When done right, results map truly reflects understanding complex issue. Secondly, although current discussions IBIS focus applications dialogue mapping, important role play mapping organizational knowledge. Maps offer powerful means navigate complex network knowledge within organisation. The (aspirational) end-goal effort "global" knowledge map highlights interconnections different kinds knowledge exists within organization. To sure, map will make little sense human eye, powerful search capabilities make navigable. To extent feasible direction, I foresee IBIS becoming important skill repertoire knowledge management professionals.
