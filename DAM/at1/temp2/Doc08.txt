Any future-directed activity degree uncertainty, uncertainty implies risk. Bad stuff happens   anticipated events unfold planned unanticipated events occur. The main function risk management deal negative aspect uncertainty. The events last years suggest risk management practiced many organisations working. A book Douglas Hubbard entitled, The Failure Risk Management   Why Broken How Fix It, discusses many commonly used risk management practices flawed needs done fix . This post summary review book. Interestingly, Hubbard began writing book well financial crisis 2008 began unfold. So although discusses matters pertaining risk management finance, book much broader scope. For instance, will interest project program/portfolio management professionals many flawed risk management practices Hubbard mentions often used project risk management. The book divided three parts: first part introduces crisis risk management; second deals popular risk management practices flawed; third discusses needs done fix . My review covers main points section roughly order appear book. The crisis risk management There several risk management methodologies techniques use ; quick search will reveal . Hubbard begins book asking following simple questions : Do risk management methods work? Would organisation uses techniques know work? What consequences work His contention organisations answers first two questions negative. To answer third question, gives example crash United Flight 232 1989. The crash attributed simultaneous failure three independent ( redundant) hydraulic systems. This happened systems located rear plane debris damaged turbine cut lines . This example common mode failure   single event causing multiple systems fail. The probability event occurring estimated less one billion. However, reason turbine broke inspected properly (.e. human error). The probability estimate considered human oversight, way likely one--billion. Hubbard uses example make point weak risk management methodology can huge consequences. Following brief history risk management historical times present, Hubbard presents list common methods risk management. These : Expert intuition   essentially based "gut feeling" Expert audit   based expert intuition independent consultants. Typically involves development checklists also uses stratification methods (see next point) Simple stratification methods   risk matrices canonical example stratification methods. Weighted scores   assigned scores different criteria (scores usually assigned expert intuition), followed weighting based perceived importance criterion. Non-probabilistic financial analysis  techniques computing financial consequences best worst case scenarios Calculus preferences   structured decision analysis techniques multi-attribute utility theory analytic hierarchy process. These techniques based expert judgements. However, cases multiple judgements involved techniques ensure judgements logically consistent (.e. contradict principles logic). Probabilistic models   involves building probabilistic models risk events. Probabilities can based historical data, empirical observation even intuition. The book essentially builds case evaluating risks using probabilistic models, provides advice built The book also discusses state risk management practice ( end 2008) assessed surveys carried The Economist, Protiviti Aon Corporation. Hubbard notes surveys based largely self-assessments risk management effectiveness. One place much confidence self-assessments risk subject well known psychological effects cognitive biases (tendencies base judgements flawed perceptions) Dunning-Kruger effect (overconfidence one's abilities). The acid test assessment whether use sound quantitative measures. Many firms surveyed fail count: quantify risks well claim . Assigning weighted scores qualitative judgements count sound quantitative technique   later. So, good ways measuring effectiveness risk management? Hubbard lists following: Statistics based large samples   use depends availability historical data similar situation hand. Direct evidence   risk management technique actually finds problem found otherwise. For example, audit unearths dubious financial practices Component testing   even one able test method end--end, may possible test specific components make method. For example, method uses computer simulations, may possible validate simulations applying known situations. Check completeness   organisations need ensure risk management methods cover entire spectrum risks, else danger mitigating one risk may increase probability another. Further, Hubbard states, "A risk even radar managed ." As far completeness concerned, four perspectives need taken account. These : Internal completeness   covering parts organisation External completeness   covering external entities organisation interacts . Historical completeness   involves covering worst case scenarios historical data. Combinatorial completeness   involves considering combinations events may occur together; may lead common-mode failure discussed earlier. Finally, Hubbard closes first section observation better use formal methodology use one flawed. Why? Because flawed methodology can lead incorrect decision made high confidence. Why broken Hubbard begins section identifying four major players risk management game. These : Actuaries: These perhaps first modern professional risk managers. They use quantitative methods manage risks insurance pension industry. Although methods actuaries use generally sound, profession slow pick new techniques. Further, many investment decisions insurance companies come purview actuaries. So, actuaries typically cover entire spectrum organizational risks. Physicists mathematicians: Many rigorous risk management techniques came statistical research done second world war. Hubbard therefore calls group War Quants. One notable techniques come effort Monte Carlo Method   originally proposed Nick Metropolis, John Neumann Stanislaw Ulam technique calculate averaged trajectories neutrons fissile material (see article Nick Metropolis first-person account method developed). Hubbard believes Monte Carlo simulations offer sound, general technique quantitative risk analysis. Consequently spends fair pages discussing methods, albeit basic level. More later. Economists: Risk analysts investment firms often use quantitative techniques economics. Popular techniques include modern portfolio theory models options theory ( Black-Scholes model) . The problem models often based questionable assumptions. For example, Black-Scholes model assumes rate return stock normally distributed (.e. value lognormally distributed)   assumption demonstrably incorrect witnessed events last years . Another way economics plays role risk management behavioural studies, particular recognition decisions regarding future events ( risks stock prices) subject cognitive biases. Hubbard suggests role cognitive biases risk management consistently overlooked. See post entitled Cognitive biases meta-risks follow- point. Management consultants: In Hubbard's view, management consultants standards institutes largely responsible many ad-hoc approaches risk management. A particular favourite folks ad-hoc scoring methods involve ordering risks based subjective criteria. The scores assigned risks thus subject cognitive bias. Even worse, tools used scoring can end ordering risks incorrectly. Bottom line: many risk analysis techniques used consultants standards justification. Following discussion main players risk arena, Hubbard discusses confusion associated definition risk. There plethora definitions risk, originated academia. Hubbard shows contradict others downright non-intuitive incorrect. In , clarifies academic professional terminology around risk. As example, takes exception notion risk "good thing"   PMI definition, views risk " uncertain event condition , occurs, positive negative effect project objective." This definition contradicts common (dictionary) usage term risk ( generally includes bad stuff). Hubbard's opinion may raise eyebrows ( hackles!) project management circles, I reckon point. In opinion, important sections book chapters 6 7, Hubbard discusses "expert knowledge opinions" (favoured standards methodologies flawed) popular scoring method (risk matrices) "worse useless." See posts limitations scoring techniques Cox's risk matrix theorem detailed discussions points. A major problem expert estimates overconfidence. To overcome , Hubbard advocates using calibrated probability assessments quantify analysts' abilities make estimates. Calibration assessments involve getting analysts answer trivia questions eliciting confidence intervals answer. The confidence intervals checked proportion correct answers. Essentially, assesses experts' abilities estimates tracking often right. It found people can improve ability make subjective estimates calibration training   .e. repeated calibration testing followed feedback. See site probability calibration. Next Hubbard tackles several "red herring" arguments commonly offered reasons manage risks using rigorous quantitative methods. Among arguments quantitative risk analysis impossible : Unexpected events predicted. Risks measured accurately. Hubbard states first objection invalid although events ( spectacular stockmarket crashes) may overlooked models, prove quantitative risk whole flawed. As discusses later book, many models go wrong assuming Gaussian probability distributions fat-tailed ones appropriate. Of course, given limited data difficult figure distribution's right one. So, although Hubbard's argument correct, offers little comfort analyst model events occur. As far second concerned, Hubbard written another book just business variable (even intangible ones) can measured. The book makes persuasive case quantities interest can measured, difficulties. First, figuring factors affect variable straightforward task. It depends, among things, availability reliable data, analyst's experience etc. Second, much depends judgement analyst, judgements subject bias. Although calibration may help reduce certain biases overconfidence, means panacea biases. Third, risk-related measurements generally involve events yet occur. Consequently, measurements based incomplete information. To make progress one often make additional assumptions may justifiable priori. Hubbard strong advocate quantitative techniques Monte Carlo simulations managing risks. However, believes often used incorrectly. Specifically: They often used without empirical data validation   .e. inputs results tested observation. Are generally used piecemeal   .e. used parts organisation , often manage low-level, operational risks. They frequently focus variables important ( easier measure) rather important. Hubbard calls perverse occurrence measurement inversion. He contends analysts often exclude important variables considered " uncertain." They use inappropriate probability distributions. The Normal distribution ( bell curve) always appropriate. For example, see posts inherent uncertainty project task estimates intuitive discussion form probability distribution project task durations. They account correlations variables. Hubbard contends many analysts simply ignore correlations risk variables (.e. treat variables independent actually ). This almost always leads underestimation risk correlations can cause feedback effects common mode failures. Hubbard dismisses argument rigorous quantitative methods Monte Carlo " hard." I agree, principles behind Monte Carlo techniques hard follow   I take opportunity plug article entitled An introduction Monte Carlo simulations project tasks . As far practice concerned, several commercially available tools automate much mathematical heavy-lifting. I recommend , search using key phrase monte carlo simulation tool will reveal many. How Fix The last part book outlines Hubbard's recommendations improving practice risk management. Most material presented draws previous section book. His main suggestions : Adopt language, tools philosophy uncertain systems. To recommends: Using calibrated probabilities express uncertainties. Hubbard believes person makes estimates will used models calibrated. He offers suggestions people can improve ability estimate calibration   discussed earlier web site. Employing quantitative modelling techniques model risks. In particular, advocates use Monte Carlo methods model risks. He also provides list commercially available PC-based Monte Carlo tools. Hubbard makes point modelling forces analysts decompose systems interest understand relationships components (see point 2 ). Developing understanding basic rules probability including independent events, conditional probabilities Bayes' Theorem. He gives examples situations rules can help analysts extrapolate To , I also add important understand idea estimate number, probability distribution   .e. range numbers, probability attached . Build, validate test models using reality ultimate arbiter. Models built iteratively, testing assumption observation. Further, models need incorporate mechanisms (.e. observations ), just raw observations. This often hard , least models incorporate correlations variables. Note correlations often ( always!) indicative underlying mechanism. See post introductory example Monte Carlo simulation involving correlated variables. Lobbying risk management given appropriate visibility organisation.s In penultimate chapter book, Hubbard fleshes characteristics traits good risk analysts. As mentions several times book, risk analysis empirical science   arises experience. So, although analytical mathematical (modelling) aspects risk important, good analyst must, , empiricist   .e. believe knowledge risks can come observation reality. In particular, tesing models seeing well match historical data tracking model predictions absolutely critical aspects risk analysts job. Unfortunately, many analysts measure performance risk models. Hubbard offers excellent suggestions analysts can refine improve models via observation. Finally, Hubbard emphasises importance creating organisation-wide approach managing risks. This ensures organisations will tackle important risks first, risk management budgets will spent effective way. Many tools approaches suggests book effective used consistent way across entire organisation. In reality, though, risk management languishes way priorities senior executives. Even profess understanding importance managing risks rigorous way, rarely offer risk managers organisational visibility support need jobs.
