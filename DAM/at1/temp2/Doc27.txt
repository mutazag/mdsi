Change, cliché goes, constant. At given time, organisations either planning implementing changes kind. Perhaps ubiquity, rationale results change questioned deeply . In post I describe unintended effects organisational change, drawing Barbara Czarniawska's book, A Theory Organizing sources. I also briefly discuss ways side effects can avoided. I'll begin words terminology. In article planned changes (also referred reforms) changes instituted order achieve specific goals. The goals reforms referred planned effects   , planned effects intended results change. As I discuss , although planned effects may eventually achieved, change initiatives host unforeseen significant consequences. These referred unplanned, unintended side effects. This article organised follows: I'll begin describing positive negative side effects change, following I'll discuss side effects come can managed. Advantageous side effects change Although, term side effect negative connotation, side effects change can actually advantageous. These include: Questioning status quo: In organisations, processes structures taken granted, rarely status quo questioned. Organisational change presents opportunity pose "How can better?" type questions challenge way things done. Such questioning unplanned generally occurs spontaneously. Opportunities reflection: This consequence previous point: questioning status quo can cause people reflect things can done better. Again, unintended consequence reform, part planned goals. Also, noted although opportunities reflection arise often, generally ignored time pressures. Spontaneous inventions: Finally, questioning reflecting status quo can trigger ideas improvement. Most people agree points indeed Good Things encouraged. However, important point people throes planned change seldom time motivation pursue opportunities. Harmful side effects change The negative side effects planned changes insidious tend occur result inaction   .e. taking corrective actions counter detrimental effects change. The following side effects serve illustrate point: The aims reform become cast stone: The objectives change initiative formulated based understanding situation exists particular point time. Problem , time evolves original objectives maybecome irrelevant obsolete. Yet, many (?) change initiatives, objectives rarely reviewed adjusted. The means get confused ends: Following previous point, change initiative becomes pointless objectives longer relevant. However, common reaction situations continue initiative, justifying worthwhile end . For example, benefits , say, restructuring initiative become moot, restructuring becomes objective rather benefits supposed flow . This helps save face project can declared success restructuring completed, regardless whether promised benefits realised. Improvisations spontaneous inventions suppressed: As I discussed length post, planning improvisation complementary contradictory aspects organizational work. A negative aspect planned change initiatives inimical improvisations: responsible overseeing change tend ignore, even suppress improvisations arise seen getting way achieving objectives primary change. Planned change initiatives generally implemented programs projects. In fact, major projects organisations   restructurings, enterprise system implementations etc   aimed implementing reforms kind. However, although raison d'etre projects achieve planned objectives, many suffer negative side effects mentioned . In book Czarniawska states, "Planned change rarely, ever, leads planned effects." Although claim may tad exaggerated, significant proportion large projects fail suggests least whiff truth . In next two sections I take brief look planned changes fail can done . The origin side effects change Most structures processes within organisations complex, path-dependent history. Among things, develop ways unique organisation often deeply intertwined . As result, impossible certain consequences changing processes structures   just many variables dependencies involved. There two related points flow : Firstly, plan changes need good understanding legacy: history issues change aims fix may create future. The problem people involved planning, initiating executing reforms little appreciation issues. Secondly, major changes conceived small number people hold positions authority within organisations. These folks tendency gloss complexities, often fail involve detailed knowledge affected processes structures. Consequently, plans overlook dependencies possible knock- effects can arise . This results negative side effects discussed previous section. .. can done Czarniawska recommends following informal rules successful change: Be willing modify objectives change path get understanding evolves. Implement lightweight processes, avoid bureaucratic procedures. Be open improvisations. This good advice goes, exactly one use ? In recently published book, The Heretic's Guide Best Practices, Paul Culmsee I discuss issues legacy lack inclusiveness can addressed. Firstly, suggest apart time, cost scope ( classic iron triangle), project decision-makers well served considering legacy separate variable projects (also see post Paul's blog point). More importantly, describe techniques can used surface hidden assumptions aspects history bearing project might cause problems future. Secondly, discuss one can work towards creating environment diverse group stakeholders can air reconcile viewpoints. Such discussion prerequisite creating plan : ) considers many viewpoints (variables) possible b) support stakeholders. Without , implementation bound side-effects overlooked variables / actions ( non-actions) stakeholders support plan. Of course, inclusiveness sounds great can difficult practice, especially large organisations. What can decision-makers cases? The answer comes slightly different, rather obvious direction. In illuminating book decision-making, James March notes organisations face messy inconsistent environments. Given , decisions made implemented lower levels better chance success made rarefied air board-rooms. Paraphrasing statement book: Since knowledge local conditions specialized competencies essential readily found decentralized units, control details policy implementation adaptation general policies local conditions [best] delegated local units. From standpoint general management, strategy usually seen one gaining informational motivational advantages using people local involvement, [] cost accentuating problems central coordination control. Indeed, nasty side effects planned change arise -centralisation coordination control. The solution devolve control decision-making authority level changes implemented. Conclusion Planned change fails achieve goals planners foresee consequences change even know factors may important determining . Moreover, individuals will view changes lens background, biases interests. Since organisations consist many individuals different views, managing change essentially wicked problem. To sum , initiate large-scale changes keep mind law unintended consequences: planned action will consequences intended, even foreseen. These consequences can managed getting better appreciation factors affect processes structures changed. One can gain understanding factors consideration legacy / via dialogue involving work processes structures changed. The simplest way achieve delegating decision making implementation authority belongs   people work coalface organisation.
