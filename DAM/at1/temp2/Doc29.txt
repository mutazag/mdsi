Over last two decades , recognized creativity innovation tend thrive organisations employees say decisions affect work. This lead notion post-bureaucratic organisation   organisation decisions made collectively dialogue consensus, hierarchy flat. Although number workgroups within large organizations function way ( success ), post-bureaucratic organisation generally seen utopian academic ideal; one unlikely work real world. Those manage organizations, departments workgroups generally uncomfortable employees working autonomously, even though might lead generation novel ideas products. This understandable: ultimately responsibility managers ensure organisational departmental goals achieved. How else time-tested command control approach management? In response question posed , project management often touted means manage creative innovative efforts organisations (see articles issue PM Network, example). The claim seems reasonable one: project management ( definition) provides means manage collective, goal oriented endeavours. Further, many projects   especially involving new product software development   creative/innovative component. In practice, though, project management tends bureaucratic affair; involving plans must followed, schedules must adhered regular progress reports must made. Even ( perhaps, ) many organizations see project management means manage creative work post-bureaucratic setting. Implicit view assumption implementation project management processes will enable managers control direct creative work without adverse side-effects. An article Damian Hodgson entitled Project Work: The Legacy Bureaucratic Control Post-Bureaucratic Organisation, explores tensions contradictions presented notion. Although article written ago ( 2003), I believe ideas explored ever relevant today, particularly view increasing projectisation organisations work carried within . Hence motivation summarise review paper. Background   setting stage To fair, many organizations recognise "light hand rudder" needed order encourage creativity innovation. In organisations, project management often seen means achieve . But well work practice? Hodgson's paper aims provide insight question via case study organization project-based form management implemented means balance requirements creativity control. In words: In response challenges post-bureaucratic form, project management put forward many ‘tried--tested' package techniques able cope discontinuous work, expert labour continuous unpredictable change delivering levels reliability control traditional bureaucracy. In article I explore contradictions tensions within department ‘hybrid' mode control implemented, embodying bureaucratic post-bureaucratic logics. In particular, I focus upon discursive tactics employed sell ‘rebureaucratization' ‘debureaucratization', complex employee responses initiative. I argue tensions evident cast significant doubt feasibility seamless integration bureaucracy post-bureaucratic [organization]. The "discursive tactics" Hodgson mentions (seemingly reasonable rational) arguments organization might use "sell" idea methods approaches project management consistent ideals post-bureaucratic organization. An example argument goes follows: project management routinely used manage new product development projects, eminently suited managing creative work (Incidentally, quite right   see paper review ) Post bureaucracy vs. bureaucracy Before moving , worth comparing characteristics bureaucratic post-bureaucratic organizations. Hodgson provides following comparison, based work Charles Hekscher: Bureacracy Post-bureaucracy Consensus Acquiescence Authority Consensus Institutionalized Dialogue Influence based Formal Position Influence Persuasion/PersonalQualities Internal Trust Immaterial High Need Internal Trust Emphasis Rules Regulations Emphasis Organizational Mission Information Monopolised Top Hierarchy Strategic Information shared Organization Focus Rules Conduct Focus Principles Guiding Action Fixed ( Clear) Decision Making Processes Fluid/Flexible Decision Making Processes Network Specialized FunctionalRelationships Communal Spirit/Friendship Groupings Hierarchical Appraisal Open Visible Peer Review Processes Definite Impermeable Boundaries Open Permeable Boundaries Objective Rules ensure Equity Treatment Broad Public Standards Performance Expectation Constancy Expectation Change The aim case study highlight inconsistencies contradictions result applying bureaucratic mechanism (project management) manage work group good creative work, used free-wheeling, hands- management style (.e. group approximates idealised post-bureaucratic environment described ). Why project management? Project management roots classical management (ala Taylor Fayol), perhaps surprising considered means manage work post-bureaucratic setting. In Hodgson's words: I argue distinguishes project management particular relevance 21stcentury organizations rediscovery 19th-century preoccupation comprehensive planning, linked belief necessity tight managerial discipline. Project management tools techniques support managerial discipline providing means decompose project manageable bits   using WBS say   assigning bits individuals ( small teams). The work assigned can tracked controlled tightly   good thing. If matter rested bad, often management also prescibes work done. This level control results loss autonomy ( motivation) team members whose job work. The loss motivation can negative effects, especially projects large creative component. To counter criticism, recent years project management started focus creative aspects projects   needed motivate teams, foster creativity ( new product development work, say) etc. As Hodgson puts , The linking project management change management increased project management's influence across industries, now largest professional organization project management includes special interest groups areas diverse healthcare, retail, media, marketing, hospitality. As consequence last decade time particularly rapid expansion project management, issues change, knowledge management, constant innovation emerged central themes popular management discourse. So, project management offers two (seemingly contradictory) benefits: ability maintain tight control work ability foster innovation creativity:  project management can seen essentially bureaucratic system control, based principles visibility, predictability accountability, operationalized adherence formalized procedure constant written reporting mechanisms. At time, however, project management draws upon rhetoric empowerment, autonomy self-reliance central  In principle, , project management offers system attempts integrate bureaucratic control form responsible autonomy keeping interdisciplinary, knowledge-intensive nature much project work teams. Seen light, perhaps surprising project management viewed means manage creative work. The case study With background done, I now move discussion case study. In Hodgson's words, study:  focused upon telephone bank northern England I referred pseudonym Buzzbank. In late 1980s, Buzzbank set major UK bank, I will call TN Banking, represented one several success stories retail banking sector period. Through reduced overheads extensive use new technology form sophisticated marketing techniques call-centre technology, Buzzbank expanded rapidly terms market share turnover, developing key component TN Banking's global operations. My interest particular centred Buzzbank senior management's identification project management prime ‘critical success factor' organization; development project management expertise throughout organization seen key priority maintain performance next decade. To extent, project teams researched scarcely ‘cutting edge', representing highly-trained ‘knowledge workers' developing innovative high technology applications solutions new sector enormously profitable industry Hodgson conducted interviews observed operations within IT department Buzzbank period two years. During period, organization implementing "strategic plan" aimed formalizing innovation creative work using project management processes. The idea, words couple senior IT managers "bring level discipline" "bring idea professional structuring" work highly successful unit. The structuring discipline achieved implementing project management processes. The main rationale used sell project management Buzzbank IT team familiar one: need ensure predictability repeatability work done whilst ensuring innovation creativity impeded. Another justification offered management size organization ( grown considerably years prior implementation strategic plan) meant existing "ad-hoc" work culture longer successful. That , size organization necessitated degree formalization, ergo bureaucratic procedures put place. This rationalised ( senior management) natural inevitable consequence growth:  The organization therefore portrayed senior management IT approaching ‘next stage evolution'. The immediate benefit metaphor members senior management charged rebureaucratizing organization carries strong sense inevitability. As , casts opposition changes irrational futile, standing way natural ‘evolution'. Further, managers organization dubbed employee resistance "natural growing pains"   like adolescent, say. Cast light, dissenting viewpoints portrayed natural unavoidable   possibly even necessary   ultimately without validity. Another interesting aspect Hodgson highlights way old practices ( successful "bad" ones) subsumed new (formal) framework. For example, old world, employees given freedom experiment, many considered strength weakness. In new world, however, practice seen threat; considered important capture things correctly things became repeatable (ala best practice) experimentation necessary. As one manager put : If capture things right, least makes things repeatable, can record improvement required things go right, happen rapidly-expanding, gung-ho environment. Hodgson notes terms rapidly-expanding gung-ho, used negative sense, just well cast positive terms flexible, proactive etc. The point management framed existing situation terms made implementation new procedures seem like logical reasonable next step. The processes touted means achieve change (.e. flexible), controlled way. So, management went great lengths avoid use terms perceived negative   example, term "structure" used instead "bureaucracy" "formalization." In way, management attempted assimilate existing values Buzzbank strategic plan. So, well work? Here's Hodgson says end result: The impression given [ senior management] organizational change inevitable, gave rise understandable irrational resistance, now effectively completed, good organization whole. On hand, impression Hodgson got speaking lower level employees different: However, time spent organization, tone target much humour, well much stronger reactions, appeared throw doubt extent discourse permeated among general employees, particularly within IT department. Humour commonplace everyday banter within teams teams IT division Buzzbank, increasing levels bureaucratization butt humour, particularly lower levels hierarchy. The main experience project management reported many Buzzbank employees one intensified bureaucratic surveillance  A key example reaction employees managerial jargon used company circulars literature intended promote strategic plan. Typically, comments provoked circulation literature strategic plan, , excerpts document read members staff, adding ironic comments underline gap document experience life work department. Hodgson notes employees often appeared comply new regulations, way intended management: At times, employees appeared comply formal requirements new system, terms filling necessary forms, reporting given times, completing necessary work-logs . Even , despite relative sophistication senior management's re-articulation key discourses, compliance part Buzzbank employees many cases bore hallmarks instrumental behaviour, accompanied insubordinate statements humour ranging cynical confrontational. At times, assurances given senior management immediately contravened, fictionalized accounts project activities submitted late, else procedures observed meticulously detriment deadlines constraints. The emergent organizational order precarious negotiation alienated compliance autonomous disregard bureaucratic demands  In short: clear gap perceptions management employees success newly implemented processes. It clear Buzzbank managers saw project management means control direct creative / innovative work way negative effect employee morale motivation. The challenge, course, lay achieving employee buy-. Management used many creative (!) tactics "sell" project management staff. These included: References "natural process evolution" consequent "growing pains" organization experience. This made pain change natural inevitable, necessary interest future gain. Manipulation terminology make changes seem palatable   e.g. using word "structure" instead "formalization" "bureaucracy". Co-opting terminology post-bureaucratic organizations literature designed promote new structure. For example, claiming project management processes enable organization even responsive change (.e. flexible), change management processes. From employees' perspective, techniques plainly seen : methods "sell unsellable". The negative reactions employees manifested sarcastic humour (often minor) acts insubordination. The case study thus highlights difficulties using project management means control work post-bureaucratic work environment. Wrapping-: reflections summary Hodgson sees case study exemplifying problem control vs. autonomy emerging post-bureaucratic organizations: managers view project management means address risks inherent post-bureaucratic work, whereas employees view unnecessary unjustified imposition. Management looking "best worlds", hybrid model incorporated best elements post bureaucratic model traditional command control approach. The case study casts doubt whether hybrid possible solely implementation standard project management techniques processes. It exposing tensions differences perceptions can occur model implemented. So leave managers? Is way manage creative work without destroying employee morale motivation? Looking complaints Buzzbank employees, clear problems arose loss autonomy enjoyed prior implementation new processes. This case, measure increase autonomy improve situation. A couple possibilities come mind   I discussed earlier pieces. These : Empower employees make decisions affect work. This means allowing freedom decide best approach solving problems (within limits specified organisational resource constraints). In situations (1) possible, one use collaborative techniques dialogue mapping achieve employee buy-. Of course, management prepared engage true dialogue, willing act upon (reasonable) suggestions made employees. The key message simple obvious: say employees making work-related decisions, engaged motivated . This just warm fuzzy notion, one backed research motivation (see paper review, example). Yes, mean letting go "reins control" extent clear, highlighted Hodgson's work, holding reins tightly might cause problems solves. What's called , , degree flexibility: use project management processes means, open employee input working well . To sum : Hodgson's case study suggests inflexible project management based approaches managing creative work may work well advertised purveyors frameworks methodologies. As alternative, might worth taking step towards utopian ideal post-bureaucratic organisation using techniques encourage employee input organisational decision making.
