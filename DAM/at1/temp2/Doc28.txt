It truism two organisations using project management practices structures will different levels success . Clearly, lot project success project management. Despite , studies project success tend focus project level, operational, variables level user involvement, use ( ) formal methodology, reliability estimates etc (Note: variables taken oft quoted Standish Report). As important factors , fail take account projects live evolve wider environment includes sponsoring organisation. A recent paper entitled, New Product Development Projects: The Effects Organizational Culture published December 2007 issue Project Management Journal, studies effect organisational culture project success specific reference new product development (NPD) projects. I summarise review paper . The authors claim despite importance NPD projects long term success organisation, effect strategic level variables (organisational culture, organizational strategy, management involvement etc.) project success widely studied. They suggest might variables hard define, quantify measure. Further, reviewing existing literature, find published, organisation-oriented studies tend focus end result development process (.e. product) rather factors affecting project. Hence motivation study. Incidentally, note work effect national culture NPD project performance, studies find correlation two. To measure something elusive organisational culture, first pin defining . The definition -encompassing, needs precise enough people common understanding talking . To , authors created set questions based various definitions organisational culture available literature. The resulting questionnaires mailed various organisations engaged NPD projects. The responses received ( hundred organisations) analysed using exploratory factor analysis, enabling authors group questions following dimensions organisational culture: Positive work environment: includes factors openness new ideas, employees feeling valued individuals, open discussion superiors encouraged etc. Management leadership: includes factors clear goals set responsibilities delegated, employees input decision making, incentives offered work new ideas, high-risk high-return projects encouraged etc. Results orientation: includes factors employees pressured finish work, correct procedures important correct results etc. These dimensions define organisational culture purposes study. To measure project success, authors use following dimensions adapted Griffin Page: Consumer-based: customers satisfied product. This can also classed Customer Satisfaction. Commercial success: product makes money Technical success: product works intended. Note variables actually subset suggested Griffin Page. Project success measured getting upper management surveyed companies rate product success along dimensions. Finally, authors correlate organisational culture product success ( surveyed companies) using correlation regression analysis. The results ( really surprise) indicate : Positive work environments management leadership strongly correlated three measures product success. That : Strong management leadership positive work environments go hand--hand. Companies positive work environments (, implication, strong management leadership) better commercial success new products, enjoy better customer satisfaction greater technical success less positive work environments (, implication, weak leadership). Results orientation strongly correlated variables. If seems surprising first sight, take another look goes making variable will seem less ! Although paper focuses NPD projects, I think conclusions   especially pertaining customer satisfaction technical success   apply projects well. Further, though conclusions may obvious many, research important lends analytical backing otherwise intuitive notions. It : Defining (albeit, limited way) meant organisational culture project success. Studying relationship variables make two. Defining variables quantifying relationships can give us sense organisational culture variables significant determinants project success. So, although study preliminary one ( authors admit), work useful step understanding relationship projects larger environment projects live breathe.
