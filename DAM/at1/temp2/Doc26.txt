The platitude " people important asset" reflects belief survival evolution organisations depends intellectual cognitive capacities individuals comprise . However, view many well documented examples actions demonstrate lack foresight / general callousness fate organisations work , one wonder belief justified, even really believed spout platitudes. Indeed, cases Enron Worldcom ( mention just two) seem suggest stupidity may fairly prevalent present day organisations. This point subject brilliant paper Andre Spicer Mats Alvesson entitled, A stupidity based theory organisations. This post extensive summary review paper. Background The notion success organization depends intellectual rational capabilities people seems almost obvious. Moreover, good deal empirical research seems support . In opening section paper, Alvesson Spicer cite many studies appear establish developing knowledge ( employees) hiring smart people key success ever-changing, competitive environment. These claims mirrored theoretical work organizations. For example Nonaka Takeuchi's model knowledge conversion acknowledges importance tacit knowledge held employees. Although still much debate tacit/explicit knowledge divide, models serve perpetuate belief knowledge ( one form another) central organisational success. There also broad consensus decision making organizations, though subject bounded rationality related cognitive biases, large rational process. Even decision wholly rational, usually attempt depict . Such behaviour attests importance attached rational thinking organization-land. At end spectrum decisions can described , well  stupid. As Rick Chapman discusses entertaining book, In Search Stupidity, organizations occasionally make decisions plain dumb However, behaviour seldom remains hidden rather obvious negative consequences organisation. Such stories thus end immortalized business school curricula canonical examples . Functional stupidity Notwithstanding remarks obvious stupidity, another category foolishness perhaps pervasive remains unnoticed unremarked. Alvesson Spicer use term functional stupidity refer "organizationally supported lack reflexivity, substantive reasoning, justitication." In words, functional stupidity amounts " refusal use intellectual resources outside narrow ‘safe' terrain." It reflected blinkered approach organisational problems, wherein people display unwillingness consider think solutions lie outside arbitrary boundary. A common example certain topics explicitly tacitly deemed " bounds" discussion. Many "business usual" scenarios riddled functional stupidity, precisely often hard detect. As per definition offered , three cognitive elements functional stupidity: Lack reflexivity: refers inability unwillingness question claims commonly accepted wisdom. Lack substantive reasoning: This refers reasoning based small set concerns span whole issue. A common example sort myopia organisations focus efforts achieving certain objectives little questioning objectives . Lack justification: This happens employees question managers , hand, provide explanations regarding actions. Often consequence power relationships organisations. This may, example, dissuade employees "sticking necks " asking questions managers might deem bounds. It noted functional stupidity little limitations human cognitive capacities. Nor anything ignorance, carelessness lack thought. The former can rectified education / hiring consultants requisite knowledge, latter via use standardised procedures checklists. It also important note functional stupidity necessarily bad thing. For example, placing certain topics bounds, organisations can avoid discussions potentially controversial topics can thus keep conflict uncertainty bay. This maintains harmony, doubt, also strengthens existing organisational order turn serves reinforce functional stupidity. Of course, functional stupidity also negative consequences, chief one prevents organisations finding solutions issues involve topics arbitrarily deemed bounds. Examples functional stupidity There many examples functional stupidity recent history, couple irrational exuberance wake internet boom 1990s, lack critical examination complex mathematical models lead financial crisis last decade. However, one look much beyond one's work environment find examples functional stupidity. Many come category "business usual" " just way things done around "   phrases used label practices ritually applied without much thought reflection. Such practices often remain unremarked easy link negative outcomes. Indeed, authors point " managerial practices adopted basis faulty reasoning, accepted wisdom complete lack evidence." The authors cite example companies adopting HR practices actually detrimental employee organisational wellbeing. Another common example organisations place high value gathering information used meaningful way. I discussed "information perversity" length post entitled, The unspoken life information organisations, I rehash . Alvesson Spicer point information perversity consequence high cultural value placed information: seen prerequisite "proper" decision making. However, reality often used justify questionable decisions simply "hide behind facts." These examples suggest functional stupidity may norm rather exception. This scary thought  I suspect may surprising many readers. The dynamics stupidity Alvesson Spicer claim functional stupidity common feature organisations. To understand pervasive, one look dynamics stupidity   established factors influence . They suggest root cause lies fact organisations attempt short-circuit critical thinking call economies persuasion, activities corporate culture initiatives, leadership training team / identity building, relabelling positions pretentious titles   many activities aimed influencing employees use symbols images rather substance. Such symbolic manipulation, authors calls , aimed increasing employees' sense commitment organisation. As put : Organizational contexts dominated widespread attempts symbolic manipulation typically involve managers seeking shape mould ‘mind-sets' employees . A core aspect involves seeking create degree good faith conformity limit critical thinking Although efforts always successful, many employees buy thereby identify organisation. This makes employees uncritical organisation's goals means will achieved. In words, sets scene functional stupidity take root flourish. Stupidity management stupidity self-management The authors use term stupidity management describe managerial actions prevent discourage organisational actors (employees stakeholders) thinking . Some ways done include reinforcement positive images organisation, getting employees identify organisation's vision myriad organisational culture initiatives aimed burnishing image corporation. These initiatives often backed organisational structures ( hierarchies reward systems) discourage employees raising exploring potentially disruptive issues. The monitoring sanctioning activities might disrupt positive image organisation can overt ( form warnings, say). More often, though, subtle. For example, many meetings, participants participants know certain issues raised. At times, discussion debate may short circuited exhortations "stop thinking start ." Such occurrences serve create environment stupidity flourishes. The net effect managerial actions encourage stupidity employees start cast aside doubts questions behave corporately acceptable ways   words, start perform jobs unreflective unquestioning way. Some people may actually internalise values espoused management; others may psychologically distance values still act ways required . The net effect stupidity self-management ( authors call ) employees stop questioning asked just . After , doubts fade becomes accepted way working. The end result familiar situation many us know "business usual" " just way things done around ." The paradoxes consequences stupidity Functional stupidity can cause feelings certainty dissonance members organisation. Suppressing critical thinking can result easy acceptance way things . The feelings certainty come suppressing difficult questions can comforting. Moreover, toe organisational line likely offered material rewards promotions . This can act reinforce functional stupidity others see stupidity rewarded may also tempted behave similar fashion. That said, certain functionally stupid actions, ignoring obvious ethical lapses, can result serious negative outcomes organisation. This amply illustrated recent past. Such events can prompt formal inquiries level organisation, doubt accompanied informal soul-searching individual level. However, also amply illustrated, guarantee inquiries self-reflection lead major changes behaviour. Once crisis passes, people seem happy revert business usual. In end , though, stark differences rhetoric reality organisation emerge   eventually will  employees will see contradictions real organisation one asked believe . This can result alienation cynicism organisation objectives. So, although stupidity management may beneficial outcomes short run, price paid longer term. Nothing comes free, even stupidity  Conclusion The authors main message despite general belief organisations enlist cognitive intellectual capacities members positive ways, truth organisational behaviour often exhibits wilful ignorance facts / lack logic. The authors term behaviour functional stupidity. Functional stupidiy advantage maintaining harmony least short term, longer term consequences can negative. Members organisation "learn" behaviour becoming aware certain topics bounds broach risk. Conformance rewarded advancement material gain whereas dissent met overt less obvious disciplinary action. Functional stupidity thus acts barrier can stop members organisation developing potentially interesting perspectives problems organisations face. The paper makes interesting valid point pervasiveness wilfully irrational behaviour organisations. That said, I help think authors written tongue firmly planted cheek.
