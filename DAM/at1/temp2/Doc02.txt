Enterprise risk management (ERM) refers process uncertainties identified, analysed managed organization-wide perspective. In principle perspective enables organisations deal risks holistic manner, avoiding silo mentality plagues much risk management practice. This claim made ERM rate, practitioners accept . However, whether claim really holds another matter altogether. Unfortunately, available critiques ERM written academics risk management experts. In post I summarise critique ERM presented paper Michael Power entitled, The Risk Management Nothing. I'll begin brief overview ERM frameworks summarise main points paper along comments annotations. ERM Frameworks Definitions What ERM? The best way answer question look couple well-known ERM frameworks, one Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) Committee Sponsoring Organisations Treadway Commission (COSO). CAS defines ERM :   discipline organization industry assesses, controls, exploits, finances, monitors risks sources purpose increasing organization's short- long-term value stakeholders. See article overview ERM actuarial perspective. COSO defines ERM :   process, effected entity's board directors, management personnel, applied strategy setting across enterprise, designed identify potential events may affect entity, manage risk within risk appetite, provide reasonable assurance regarding achievement entity objectives. The term risk appetite definition refers risk organisation willing bear. See first article June 2003 issue Internal Auditor COSO perspective ERM. In frameworks, focus much quantifying risks (primarily) financial measures establishing accountability managing risks systematic way. All sounds sensible uncontroversial. So, problem? The problems ERM The author paper begins observation basic aim ERM identify risks can affect organisation's objectives design controls mitigation strategies reduce risks (collectively) predetermined value specified organisation's risk appetite. Operationally, identified risks monitored corrective action taken go beyond limits specified controls, much like operation thermostat. In view, risk management mechanistic process. Failures risk management seen due " right" (implementation failure) politics getting way (organizational friction), rather problem framework . The basic design framework rarely questioned. Contrary common wisdom, author paper believes design ERM flawed following three ways: The idea single, organisation-wide risk appetite simplistic. The assumption risk can dealt detailed, process-based rules (suitable audit control) questionable. The undue focus developing financial metrics controls blind "bigger picture", interconnected risks quantified controlled mechanisms. We'll now take look detail Appetite vs. appetisation As mentioned earlier, risk appetite defined risk organisation willing bear. Although ERM frameworks allow qualitative measures risk appetite, organisations implementing ERM tend prefer quantitative ones. This problem definition risk appetite can vary significantly across organization. For example, sales audit functions within organisation (will!) different appetites risk. As another example, familiar anyone reads news, usually big significant gap risk appetites financial institutions regulatory authorities. The difference risk appetites different stakeholder groups manifestation fact risk social construct   different stakeholder groups view given risk different ways, may even see certain risks risks (witness behaviour certain financial "masters universe") Since single, organisation-wide risk appetite difficult come , author suggests different approach   one takes account multiplicity viewpoints organisation; process calls "risk appetizing". This involves getting diverse stakeholders achieve consensus / agreement constitutes risk appetite. Power argues process reconciling different viewpoints risk lead realistic view risk organization willing bear. Quoting paper: Conceptualising risk appetising process might better direct risk management attention likely lacking, namely multiplicity interactions shape operational ethical boundaries level organizational practice. COSO-style ERM principles effectively limit concept risk appetite within capital measurement discourse. Framing risk appetite process ethics incentives formed reformed exclude technical conception, bring closer insights several decades organization theory. Explicitly acknowledging diversity viewpoints risk likely closer reality :   conflictual pluralistic model descriptive organizations actually work, makes lower demands organizational political rationality produce single ‘appetite' explicitly recognising institutionalising processes different appetites values can mediated. Such process difficult involves getting people different viewpoints agree constitutes sensible definition risk appetite. A process bias A bigger problem, Power's view, ERM frameworks overemphasise financial / accounting measures processes means quantifying controlling risk. As puts ERM:   fundamentally accounting-driven blueprint emphasises controls-based approach risk management. This design emphasis means efforts implementation will inherent tendency elaborate detailed controls corresponding documents trails. This problem leads "rule-based compliance" mentality wherein risks managed mechanical manner, using bureaucratic processes substitute real thought risks managed. Such process may work make-believe world risks known, unlikely work one great deal ambiguity. Power makes important point rule-based compliance chews organizational resources. The tangible effort expended compliance serves reassure organizations something manage risks. This dangerous lulls false sense security: Rule-based compliance lays regulations met, requires extensive evidence, audit trails box ‘checking'. All demands considerable work daily pressure operational staff process regulatory requirements. Yet, despite workload volume pressure, also cognitively comfortable world focuses inwards routine systems controls. The auditability controls architecture can theorized defence anxiety enables organizational agents feel work conforms legitimised principles. In comfortable, prescriptive world process-based risk management, little time imagine explore (else) go wrong. Further, latter often avoided difficult often uncomfortable process:   imagination alternative futures likely involve production discomfort, compared formal ‘comfort' auditing. The approach can take form scenario analysis participants different disciplines organization can collectively track trajectory potential decisions events. The process begins ‘encounter' risk leads confrontation limitation ambiguity. Such process necessarily involves debate dialogue   essentially deliberative process. And Power puts : The challenge expand processes support interaction dialogue de-emphasise due process   within risk management practice regulator regulated. This right course, : lot process-focused disciplines project management also benefit acknowledging responding challenge. A limited view embeddedness One imperatives ERM "embed" risk management within organisations. Among things, entails incorporating risk management explicitly job descriptions, making senior managers responsible managing risks. Although step right direction, Power argues concept embeddeness articulated ERM remains limited focuses specific business entities, ignoring wider environment context exist. The essential ( always obvious) connections entities necessarily accounted . As Power puts : ERM systems represent embeddedness sense interconnectedness; proponents seem demand intensification embedding individual entity level. Yet, latter kind embedding compliance driven risk management, epitomised Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, arguably disaster , tying resources , much worse, cognition attention ‘auditized' representations business processes. In short: focus following process-oriented approach risk management   mandated frameworks   potential de-focus attention risks less obvious, potentially significant. Addressing limitations Power believes flaws ERM can addressed looking practice business continuity management (BCM). BCM addresses issue disaster management   .e. keep organisation functioning event disaster. Consequently, significant overlap aims BCM ERM. However, unlike ERM, BCM draws specialists different fields emphasizes collective action. Such approach therefore likely take holistic view risk, real point. Regardless approach one takes, point involve diverse stakeholders work towards shared (enterprise-wide) understanding risks. Only will possible develop risk management plan incorporates varying, even contradictory, perspectives exist within organisation. There many techniques work towards shared understanding risks, issues matter. Some discussed length book. Conclusion Power suggests ERM, articulated bodies CAS COSO, flawed : It attempts quantify risk appetite organizational level   essentially impossible task different organizational stakeholders will different views risk. Risk social construct. It advocates controls rule-based approach managing risks. Such prescriptive "best" practice approach discourages debate dialogue risks. Consequently, many viewpoints missed quite possibly, many risks. Despite rhetoric ERM, implemented risk management controls processes often overlook connections dependencies entities within organisations. So, although risk management appears embedded within organisation, reality may . Power suggests ERM practice learn lessons Business Continuity Management (BCM), particular interconnected nature business risks collective action needed tackle . Indeed, approach attempts reconcile diverse risk viewpoints will huge improvement current practice. Until ERM will continue illusion, offering false comfort responsible managing risk.
