Anticipating dealing risks important part managing projects. So much frameworks methodologies devote fair bit attention risk management: example, PMI framework considers risk management one nine "knowledge areas" project management. Now, frameworks methodologies normative  . us risks managed   say anything risks actually handled projects. It perhaps much expect projects run full machinery formal risk management, reasonable expect project managers deal risks less systematic way. However, project management lore rife stories projects risks managed inadequately, managed (see post pertinent case studies). This begs question: rational reasons managing risks projects? A paper Elmar Kutsch Mark Hall entitled, The Rational Choice Not Applying Project Risk Management Information Technology Projects, addresses question. This post summary review paper. Background The paper begins brief overview risk management prescribed various standards. Risk management making decisions face uncertainty. To make right decisions, project managers need figure risks significant. Consequently, methodologies offer techniques rank risks based various criteria. These techniques based many (rather strong) assumptions, authors summarise follows: An unambiguous identification problem ( risk) including cause Perfect information relevant variables affect risk. A model risk incorporates aforementioned variables. A complete list possible approaches tackle risks. An unambiguous, quantitative internally consistent measure outcomes approach. Perfect knowledge consequences approach. Availability resources successful implementation chosen solution. The presence rational decision-makers (.e. folks free cognitive bias example) Most formal methodologies assume "self-evidently correct" (note correct, see posts cognitive biases project meta-risks limitations scoring methods risk analysis ). Anyway, regardless validity assumptions, clear achieving require great deal commitment, effort money. This, according authors, provides hint many projects run without formal risk management. In words:  despite existence self-evidently correct process manage project risk, evidence suggests project managers feel restricted applying "optimal" process manage risks. For example, Lyons Skitmore (2004) investigated factors limiting implementation risk management Australian construction projects. Similar findings barriers using risk management three Hong Kong industries found prominent study Tummala, Leung, Burchett, Leung (1997). The dominant factors constraining use project risk management lack time, problem justifying effort project risk management, lack information required quantify/qualify risk estimates. The authors review research literature find factors reduce likelihood risk management applied projects. Based findings, suggest following reasons project managers often offer justifications ( rationales) managing risks: The problem hindsight: Most risk management methodologies rely historical data calculate probabilities risk eventuation. However, many managers feel rely data specific (unique) project. The problem ownership: Risks often thought "someone else's problem". There often reluctance take ownership risk fear blame case risk response fails address risk. The problem cost justification: From premises listed clear proper risk management time-consuming, effort-laden expensive process. Many IT projects run tight budgets, risk management area perceived unnecessary expense. Lack expertise: Project managers might unaware risk management technique. I find hard believe, given practically textbooks methodologies yammer , great length, importance managing risks. Besides, pretty weak justification! The problem anxiety: By definition, risk management implies one considering things can go wrong. Sometimes, informed risks, stakeholders may decide go ahead project. Consequently, project managers may limit risk identification efforts attempt avoid making stakeholders nervous. When justifying decision manage risks, factors often presented barriers problems prevent project manager using risk management. As illustration (5) , project manager might say, "I talk risks project sponsor will freak throw office." Research Method The authors started exploratory study aimed developing understanding problem perspective IT project managers   .e. project managers actually experience application risk management projects. This study done face--face interviews. Based patterns emerged study, authors developed web-based survey administered wider group project managers. The exploratory phase involved eighteen project managers whereas -depth survey completed just hundred project managers members PMI Risk Management Special Interest Group. Although paper say , I assume project managers asked questions reference specific project involved (perhaps recent one?). I dwell research methodology; paper details. Results interpretation Four eighteen project managers interviewed exploratory study apply risk management processes projects. The reasons given interpreted authors cost justification, hindsight anxiety. I've italicized word "interpreted" previous sentence I believe responses given project managers just easily interpreted another way. I've presented arguments readers can judge . One interviewee mentioned , "At beginning, much one gave thought tackling risks. It simply happen." The authors conclude rationale managing risks case one cost justification, chain logic due lack time, investment resources managing risks justified. To seems read much response. From response appears real reason exactly interviewee states   " one thought managing risks"   .e. risks overlooked. Another interviewee stated, "It nice differently, quite vulnerable terms software development, driven States, never position proactive. The Americans say "We got update system just released ," rather telling us week advance something happening. We never ahead enough able plan." The authors interpret lack risk management case due problem hindsight   .e. risk update poses parts system anticipated, risk management possible. To interpretation seems little thin   surely, project managers understand risks arbitrary updates pose. From response appears real reason project manager able plan ahead / advance warning updates. This seems problem broken project management process rather anything risk management hindsight. My point: uncertainty known (high probability regular updates), something ( ) done whilst planning project. I've dwelt examples appears authors may occasionally fallen trap pigeon holing interviewee responses predefined rationales ( ones discussed previous section) instead listening actually said. Of course, impression based reading paper data presented therein. The authors may well (unpublished) information support classification interviewee responses. However, case, presented data paper reliability second survey depends set predefined rationales comprehensive correct. The authors present short discussion second phase study. They find formal risk management processes used one third 102 cases studied. As authors point , interesting statistic, especially considering money stake typical IT projects. In cases risk management applied, respondents asked provide reasons . The reasons given extremely varied , , authors pigeon-holed predefined categories. I present original responses interpretations readers can judge . Consider following reasons offered ( respondents) applying risk management: "We got time left." "No executive call risk measurements." "Company see value adding additional cycles project." (?) "Upper management think required ." "Ignorance thing necessary." "An initial risk analysis done, PM bother follow ." "A single risk identification workshop held early project arrival. Reason following process probably attitude members team." Interestingly, authors interpret responses ( ) attributable cost justification rationale. However, seems several ( likely) interpretations. For example: 2, 3, 4, 5 attributed lack knowledge value managing risks whereas 1, 6, 7 sound like simple ( unfortunately, rather common!) buck-passing. Conclusion Towards end paper authors make excellent point rationality decision apply risk management. From perspective formal methodoologies decision irrational. However, rationality ( lack ) cut dried. Here's authors say:   decision IT project manager apply project risk management may described irrational, least one accepts premise project manager chose apply "self-evidently" correct process optimally reduce impact risk project outcome. On hand,   person focuses statistical probability threats impacts ignores information truly irrational. Hence, project manager act sensibly , example, applying project risk management rates utility using project risk management higher utility confronting stakeholders discomforting information ."   spending money address issues may eventuate, matter. The point people make decisions based prescribed processes procedures alone; considerations. The authors go say, PMI APM claim systematic identification, analysis, response risk, project managers can achieve planned project outcome. However, findings show one-third projects, effectiveness project risk management virtually nonexistent formal project risk management process applied due problem cost justification. Now, although undeniable many projects run risk management whatsoever, I'm sure I agree last statement quote. From data presented paper, seems likely lack knowledge "buck-passing" prime reasons risk management given short shrift projects surveyed. Even cost justification offered rationale interviewees, quotes suggest real reasons quite different. This surprising: natural attribute unacceptable costs attributed oversight failure. I think may case large number projects risks managed. However, authors mention, impossible make generalisations based small samples . So, although incontrovertible significant number projects risks managed, remains open question.
