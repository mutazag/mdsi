Management, practiced, largely "getting things done." Consequently management education research tends focus improving means specified ends achieved. The ends questioned rigorously . The truth reflected high profile corporate scandals come light last decade , mention global financial crisis. Today, ever, need new kind management practice, one managers critically reflect goals pursue means aim achieve . In book entitled, Making Sense Management: A Critical Introduction, management academics Mats Alvesson Hugh Willmott describe approach management entails. This post summary central ideas described book. Critical theory relevance management The body work Alvesson Willmott draw Critical Theory, discipline based belief knowledge based dialectical reasoning   .e. reasoning dialogue   rather scientific rationality alone. The main reason science ( commonly practiced) value free therefore incapable addressing problems social ethical dimension. This idea new, even scientists Einstein commented limits scientific reasoning. Although Critical Theory roots Renaissance Enlightenment, modern avatar largely due group German social philosophers associated Frankfurt-based Institute Social Research established 1920s. Among things, philosophers argued knowledge social sciences ( management) can never truly value-free objective. Our knowledge social matters invariably coloured background, culture, education sensibilities. This obvious, : economists continue proclaim objective truths right way deal economic issues, management gurus remain ready show us one true path management excellence. The present day standard bearer Frankfurt School German social philosopher, Juergen Habermas best known theory communicative rationality   idea open dialogue, free constraints rational way decide matters importance. For super-quick introduction basic ideas communicative rationality relevance organisational settings, see post entitled, More just talk: rational dialogue project environments. For detailed ( dare I say, entertaining) introduction communicative rationality examples drawn The Borg much , look Chapter 7 book, The Heretic's Guide Best Practices, co-written Paul Culmsee. The demise command control? Many professional managers see jobs purely technical terms, involving things administration, planning, monitoring etc. They tend overlook fact technical functions carried within particular social cultural context. More point, crucial, managers work constraints power domination: free think right whatever bosses order , , turn behave subordinates exactly way. As Alvesson Willmott put : Managers intermediaries hire manage. Managers employed coordinate, motivate, appease control productive efforts others. These ‘others' necessarily share managerial agendas  Despite talk autonomy empowerment, modern day management still much control. However, modern day employees unlikely accept command control approach managed, organisations taken recourse subtler means achieving result. For example, organisational culture initiatives aimed getting employees "internalise" values organisation attempts "control sans command." The point , despite softening rhetoric management principal focus remains much days Taylor Ford. A critical look status quo A good place start critical view management area decision-making. Certain decisions, particularly made executive levels, can long term impact organisation employees. Business schools decision theory texts tells us decision-making rational process. Unfortunately, reality belies claim: decisions organisations often made basis politics ideology rather objective criteria. This case, important decisions subject critical scrutiny. Indeed possible many crises last decade avoided decisions lead subjected critical review. Many initiatives launched organisation-land origins executive-level decisions made flimsy grounds "best practice" recommendations Big 4 consulting companies. Mid-level managers required see completion faced problem justifying initiatives rank file. Change management modern organisation-land largely justifying unjustifiable defending indefensible. The critique, however, goes beyond just practice management. For example, Alvesson Willmott also draw attention things objectives organisation. They point short-sighted objectives "maximising shareholder value" lead downfall companies Enron. Moreover, also remind us issue becoming increasingly important today's world: natural resources unlimited exploited judicious, sustainable manner. As interesting important "big picture" issues , remainder post I'll focus attention management practices impact mid lower level employees. A critical look management specialisations Alvesson Willmott analyse organisational functions Human Resource Management (HRM), Marketing Information Systems (IS) critical perspective. It take far many pages justice discussion I'll just present brief summary two areas: HR IS. The rhetoric HRM organisations stands stark contradiction actions. Despite platitudinous sloganeering empowerment etc., actions HR departments aimed getting people act behave organisationally acceptable ways. Seen critical light, seemingly benign HR initiatives organizational culture events self-management initiatives exposed subtle means managerial control employees. (see paper example former one example latter). Since practice IS focuses largely technology, much IS research practice tends focus technology trends "best practices." As might expected, focus "fad month" thus turns stale rather quickly. As examples: 1990s saw explosion papers projects business process re-engineering; flavour decade 2000s service-oriented architecture; recently, seen great deal hot air cloud. Underlying lot technology related decision-making tacit assumption choices pertaining technology value-free can decided basis technical financial criteria alone. The profession whole tends take overly scientific/rational approach design implementation, often ignoring issues power politics. It can argued many failures large-scale IS projects due hyper-rational approach taken many practitioners. In similar vein, management specialisations can benefit insights come taking critical perspective. Alvesson Willmott discuss marketing, accounting functions. However, since main interest solutions rather listing (rather well-known) problems, I'll leave , directing interested reader book . Towards enlightened practice management In modern workplace common employees feel disconnected work, least time time always. In prior post, I discussed sense alienation consequence work personal lives played two distinct spheres   system lifeworld. In brief, system refers professional administrative sphere work / interact institutional authority lifeworld everyday world share others. Actions lifeworld based shared understanding issue hand whereas system . From critical analysis management specialisations presented book, evident profession, mired paradigm consisting prescriptive, top- practices, serves perpetuate system encroaching lifeworld values employees. There will say exactly . However, Alvesson Wilmott stated book, kind thinking perverse ultimately self-defeating: The devaluation lifeworld properties perverse  At least, system depends upon human beings capable communicating effectively manipulated demoralized point incapable cooperation productivity. Alvesson Willmott use term emancipation, describe process whereby employees freed shackles system-oriented thinking even partially (Note: I'm using term system sense defined   confused systems thinking, another beast altogether). Acknowledging impossible level entire organisation even department, coin term micro-emancipation describe process whereby sub-groups organisations empowered think issues devise appropriate actions , free ( extent possible) management constraints directives. Although might sound much idealistic readers, assured eminently possible implement micro-emancipatory practices real world organisations. See paper one possible framework can used within multi-organisation project along detailed case study shows framework can applied complex project environment. Alvesson Willmott warn emancipatory practices without costs, employers employees. For example, employees gained autonomy may end less productive will turn affect job security. In opinion, view, issue can addressed incrementalist approach wherein employers employees work together come micro-emancipatory projects grassroots level, case study described paper mentioned previous paragraph.   conclude Despite rhetoric autonomy empowerment, much present-day management stuck Taylorist/Fordist paradigm. In modern day organisations command control may obvious, often sneak backdoor --obvious ways. For example, employees almost always know certain things simply " bounds" discussion consequences breaching unstated boundaries can severe. In purest avatar, critical approach management seeks remove boundaries altogether. This unrealistic nothing will ever get done organisation everything open discussion; case social systems, compromise necessary. The concept micro-emancipation offers just . To sure, one go beyond rhetoric empowerment actually creating environment enables people speak minds debate issues openly. Though impossible level entire organisation, definitely possible achieve (albeit approximately) small workgroups. To conclude: book worth read, just management researchers also practicing managers. Unfortunately overly-academic style may turn practitioners, people need read .
