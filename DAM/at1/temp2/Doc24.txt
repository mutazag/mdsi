Much can learnt organization observing management things go wrong. One reaction hunt scapegoat, someone can held responsible mess. The take systemic view focuses finding root cause issue figuring can done order prevent recurring. In highly cited paper published 2000, James Reason compared contrasted two approaches error management organisations. This post extensive summary paper. The author gets point first paragraph: The human error problem can viewed two ways: person approach system approach. Each model error causation model gives rise quite different philosophies error management. Understanding differences important practical implications coping ever present risk mishaps clinical practice. Reason's paper published British Medical Journal hence focus practice medicine. His arguments conclusions, however, much wider relevance evidenced diverse areas paper cited. The person approach   , I think accurately called scapegoat approach   based belief errors can traced back individual group, party responsible held account error. This approach taken organisations colloquially referred "blame culture." To extent, looking around scapegoat natural emotional reaction error. The oft unstated reason behind scapegoating, however, avoid management responsibility. As author tells us: People viewed free agents capable choosing safe unsafe modes behaviour. If something goes wrong, seems obvious individual ( group individuals) must responsible. Seeking far possible uncouple person's unsafe acts institutional responsibility clearly interests managers. It also legally convenient  However, scapegoat approach couple serious problems hinder effective risk management. Firstly, organization depends frontline staff report problems lapses. Clearly, staff will feel safe   something simply possible organization takes scapegoat approach. The author suggests Chernobyl disaster can attributed lack "reporting culture" within erstwhile Soviet Union. Secondly, perhaps important, focus scapegoat leaves underlying cause error unaddressed. As author puts , " focusing individual origins error [ scapegoat approach] isolates unsafe acts system context." As consequence, scapegoat approach overlooks systemic features errors   example, empirical fact kinds errors tend recur within given system. The system approach accepts human errors will happen. However, contrast scapegoat approach, views errors triggered factors built system. So, something goes wrong, system approach focuses procedures used rather people executing . This difference scapegoat approach makes world difference. The system approach looks generic reasons errors accidents occur. Organisations usually series measures place prevent errors   e.g. alarms, procedures, checklists, trained staff etc. Each measures can looked upon "defensive layer" error. However, author notes, defensive layer holes can let errors "pass " ( holes arise bit later). A good way visualize series slices Swiss Cheese (see Figure 1). Figure 1: The Swiss cheese model (: http://patientsafetyed.duhs.duke.edu/module_e/swiss_cheese.html) Figure 1: The Swiss cheese model (: http://patientsafetyed.duhs.duke.edu/module_e/swiss_cheese.html) The important point holes given slice fixed position; keep opening, closing even shifting around, depending state organization. An error occurs ephemeral holes different layers temporarily line "let error ". There two reasons holes arise defensive layers: Active errors: These unsafe acts committed individuals. Active errors violations set procedures momentary lapses. The scapegoat approach focuses identifying active error person responsible . However, author points , active errors almost always caused conditions built system, brings us   Latent conditions: These flaws built system. The author uses term resident pathogens describe   nice metaphor I explored paper review I wrote years ago. These "pathogens" usually baked system poor design decisions flawed procedures one hand, ill-thought- management decisions . Manifestations former include faulty alarms, unrealistic inconsistent procedures poorly designed equipment; manifestations latter include things unrealistic targets, overworked staff lack funding appropriate equipment. The important thing note latent conditions can lie dormant long period noticed. Typically latent condition comes light error caused occurs  organization root cause analysis error   something simply done organization takes scapegoat approach. The author draws nice analogy clarifies link active errors latent conditions:  active failures like mosquitoes. They can swatted one one, still keep coming. The best remedies create effective defences drain swamps breed. The swamps, case, ever present latent conditions. "Draining swamp" simple task. The author draws upon studies high performance organisations (combat units, nuclear power plants air traffic control centres) understand minimised active errors reducing system flaws. He notes organisations: Accept errors will occur despite standardised procedures, train staff deal learn . Practice responses known error scenarios try imagine new ones regular basis. Delegate responsibility authority, especially crisis situations. Do root cause analysis error occurs address underlying problem changing system needed. In contrast, organisation takes scapegoat approach assumes standardisation will eliminate errors, ignores possibility novel errors occurring, centralises control , , focuses finding scapegoats instead fixing system.
