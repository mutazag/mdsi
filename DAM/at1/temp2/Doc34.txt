The meeting going going nowhere. Finally John came said , "There way I can 2 days," said. "It will take least week." There , point contention developer manager. Now open, real work meeting begin; two start talking realistic delivery date. The manager, call Jack, pleased, "Don't tell simple two-page web app   done several times I add   will take week . " "OK, let walk details," said John.  . went another half hour , Jack John arguing reasonable timeframe completing requested work. Dialogue, rationality action Most developers, designers indeed "doers" project teams  several conversations similar one . These folks spend fair bit time discussing matters relating projects work . In discussions, aim come shared understanding issue discussion shared commitment future action. In remainder post I'll take look project discussions somewhat philosophical perspective, view understanding obstacles open dialogue can addressed. When participate discussions want views taken seriously. Consequently, present views statements hope others will see rational   .e. based sound premises logical thought. One presumes John   made claim delivery date unrealistic   willing present arguments convince Jack indeed . The point John judged ( Jack others meeting) based validity statements (John) makes. When Jack's validity claims contested, debate ensues aim getting kind agreement. The philosophy underlying process discourse ( simply another word "debate" "dialogue") described theory communicative rationality proposed German philosopher Jurgen Habermas. The basic premise communicative rationality rationality ( reason) tied social interactions dialogue. In words, exercise reason can occur dialogue. Such communication, mutual deliberation, result general agreement issues discussion. Only agreement achieved can consensus actions need taken. Habermas refers latter communicative action, .e. action resulting collective deliberation. [Note: Just clear: I read Habermas' books, discussion based entirely secondary sources: papers authors studied Habermas detail. Incidentally, Wikipedia article topic quite good, well worth read.] Validity Claims Since objective project discussions achieve shared understanding issues shared commitment future action, one say discussions aimed achieving communicative action. The medium mutual understanding achieved speech   .e. statements speaker makes based perceptions reality. Others involved dialogue , conveying perceptions ( may may match speaker's). Now, statements made discussions implicit explicit validity claims   .e. express speaker's belief something true valid, least context dialogue. Participants disagree speaker essentially contesting claims. According theory communicative action, every utterance makes following validity claims: It makes claim objective ( external) reality. John's statement deadline impossible refers timing objective event   delivery working software. Habermas refers truth claim. It says something social reality   , expresses something relationship speaker listener(s). The relationship typically defined social workplace norms, example   relationship manager employee case John Jack. John's statement expression disagreement manager. Of course, believes position justified   take week deliver software. Habermas refers rightness claim. It expresses something subjective reality   , speaker's personal viewpoint. John believes, based experience, intutition etc., deadline impossible. For communication happen, Jack must work assumption John honest   .e. John truly believes deadline impossible, even though Jack may agree. Habermas refers truthfulness claim. The validity claims relation rationality nicely summed Wikipedia article communicative rationality, I quote: By earnestly offering speech act another communication, speaker claims say true also normatively right honest . Moreover, speaker implicitly offers justify claims challenged justify reasons. Thus, speaker, challenged, can offer acceptable reasons normative framework implied offering given speech act, speech act unacceptable irrational. When John says task going take week, implies can justify statement ( required) three ways: will take week (objective), take week (normative   based rightness) truly believes will take week (subjective). In dialogues validity claims implied, rarely tested; usually take people say face value, ask justify claims. Nevertheless, assumed can offer justifications ask . Naturally, will reason doubt validity say. It point discourse begins. As Wener Ulrich puts paper: In everyday communication, validity basis speech often treated unproblematic. The purpose consists exchanging information rather examining validity claims. None three validity claims made explicit subject discussion. It sufficient partners assume ( anticipate, Habermas likes say) speakers prepared substantiate claims asked , times possible participants switch different mode communication one several validity claims actually tested. Only validity claims indeed become problematic, one participants feels compelled dispute either speaker's sincerity empirical / normative content statements, ordinary communication breaks discourse begins. Progress project discussions actually depends breakdown "ordinary communication"   good project decisions emerge open deliberation pros cons competing approaches. Only done can one move action. Conditions ideal discourse All sounds somewhat idealistic, . Habermas noted five prerequisites open debate. They : Inclusion: affected parties included dialogue. Autonomy: participants able present criticise validity claims independently. Empathy: participants must willing listen understand claims made others. Power neutrality: power differences (levels authority) participants affect discussion. Transparency: participants must indulge strategic actions (.e. lying!). In paper Bent Flyvbjerg adds sixth point: group able take long needs achieve consensus   Flyvbjerg calls requirement unlimited time. From list clear open discourse ( communicative rationality) ideal difficult achieve practice. Nevertheless, always possible improve quality dialogue projects, behooves us project professionals strive towards ideal. In next section I'll look one practical way . Boundary judgements Most times discussions jump straight point, without bothering explain assumptions underpin statements. By glossing assumptions, however, leave open misunderstood others means assess validity statements. Consequently becomes difficult empathise us. For example, John says impossible finish work less week, support claim stating assumptions makes bear argument. He may assuming work addition stuff plate. On hand, may assuming much manager may willing reassign stuff someone else. Unless assumption brought open, two will continue argue without reaching agreement. Werner Ulrich pointed issue tacit assumptions unstated frameworks essentially one defining boundaries within one's claims hold. He coined term boundary judgement describe facts norms speaker deems relevant statements. A boundary judgement determines context within statement holds also determines range validity statement. For example, John talking deadline impossible context current work situation; situation changed, might estimate. Ulrich invented notion boundary critique address point. In essence, boundary critique way uncover boundary judgements asking right questions. According Ulrich, boundary questions probe assumptions made various stakeholders. He classifies boundary questions four categories. These : Motivation: includes questions : Why project? Who ? How will measure benefits project done? Power: includes questions : Who key decision-maker regarding scope? What resources controlled decision-maker? What resources controlled decision-maker (.e. relevant environmental factors)? Knowledge: This includes: What knowledge needed work? Who (.e professionals) knowledge? What key success factors   e.g. stakeholder consensus, management support, technical soundness etc? Legitimation: This includes: Who stakeholders (including indirectly affected project)? How ensure interests stakeholders taken account? How can conflicting views project objectives reconciled? The questions drawn paper Ulrich. I paraphrased way makes sense project environments. Many questions difficult address openly, especially relating power legitimation. Answers often bump organisational politics power. The point, however, questions asked, constraints become evident . Only happens can discourse proceed full knowledge possible . Before closing section I'll note techniques essentially thing1, I discuss I've already exceeded reasonable word count. Conclusion Someone recently mentioned problem project meetings ( indeed conversation) participants see positions rational, even . Consequently, stick views, even faced evidence contrary. According theory communicative rationality, however, folks rational subject positions views "trial argumentation". Rationality lies dialogue, individual statements positions. A productive discussion one validity claims continually challenged converge optimal decision. The best ( rational) position one emerges collective deliberation. In closing, caveat order   complete discussion dialogue projects ( organisations) take entire book . My discussion merely highlighted issues ( technique) I daresay rarely touched upon management texts courses. There many tools techniques can help improve quality discourse within organisations. Paul Culmsee I discuss book, The Heretic's Guide Best Practices.
