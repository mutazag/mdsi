The discussion risk presented textbooks project management courses follows well-trodden path risk identification, analysis, response planning monitoring (see PMBOK guide, example). All good stuff, doubt. However, much guidance offered high level. Among things, little practical advice . In post I address issue outlining common pitfalls project risk analysis. 1. Reliance subjective judgement: People see things differently: one person's risk may even another person's opportunity. For example, using new technology project can seen risk ( focusing increased chance failure) opportunity ( focusing opportunities afforded early adopter). This somewhat extreme example, fact remains individual perceptions influence way risks evaluated. Another problem subjective judgement subject cognitive biases   errors perception. Many high profile project failures can attributed biases: see post cognitive bias project failure . Given points, potential risks discussed different perspectives aim reaching common understanding dealt . 2. Using inappropriate historical data: Purveyors risk analysis tools methodologies exhort project managers determine probabilities using relevant historical data. The word relevant important: emphasises data used calculate probabilities ( distributions) situations similar one hand. Consider, example, probability particular risk   say, particular developer will able deliver module specified date. One might historical data developer, question remains data points used. Clearly, data points projects similar one hand used. But similarity defined? Although easy question answer, critical far relevance estimate concerned. See post reference class problem point. 3. Focusing numerical measures exclusively: There widespread perception quantitative measures risk better qualitative ones. However, even reliable relevant data available, measures still need based sound methodologies. Unfortunately, ad-hoc techniques abound risk analysis: see posts Cox's risk matrix theorem limitations risk scoring methods . Risk metrics based techniques can misleading. As Glen Alleman points comment, many situations qualitative measures may appropriate accurate quantitative ones. 4. Ignoring known risks: It surprising often known risks ignored. The reasons politics mismanagement. I dwell I dealt length earlier post. 5. Overlooking fact risks distributions, point values: Risks inherently uncertain, uncertain quantity represented range values, ( associated probability) rather single number (see post point). Because scarcity unreliability historical data, distributions often assumed priori: , analysts will assume risk distribution particular form (say, normal lognormal) evaluate distribution parameters using historical data. Further, analysts often choose simple distributions easy work mathematically. These distributions often reflect reality. For example, may vulnerable "black swan" occurences account outliers. 6. Failing update risks real time: Risks rarely static   evolve time, influenced circumstances events outside project. For example, acquisition key vendor mega-corporation likely affect delivery module waiting   quite likely adverse way. Such change risk obvious; may many . Consequently, project managers need reevaluate update risks periodically. To fair, point textbooks make   advice followed often . This brings end (subjective) list risk analysis pitfalls. Regular readers blog will noticed points made post similar ones I made post estimation errors. This surprise: risk analysis project estimation activities deal uncertain future, expected common problems pitfalls. One generalize point: activity involves gazing murky crystal ball will plagued similar problems.
