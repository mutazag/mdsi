Jack see discussion going nowhere: group talking pros cons competing approaches half hour, kept going around circles. As mulled , Jack got idea   playing around visual notation called IBIS (Issue-Based Information System) , looking opportunity use map discussion real time (Editor's note: readers unfamiliar IBIS may want look post one proceeding). "Why give try," thought, "I worse lot." Decision made, waited break conversation dived got one  "I suggestion," said. "There's conversation mapping tool I've exploring . I believe might help us reach common understanding approaches discussing. It may even help facilitate decision. Do mind I try ?" "Pfft   I'm helps us get decision." said Max. He'd clearly enough . Jack looked around table. Mary looked puzzled, nodded assent. Rick seemed unenthusiastic, voice objections. Andrew   boss   --goes- look face (Jack track record "ideas") , Jack's surprise, said, "OK. Why ? Go ." "Give minute get set ," said Jack. He hooked computer data projector. Within couple minutes, blank IBIS map displayed -screen. This done, glanced others: looking screen expressions ranging curiosity (Mary) skepticism (Max). "Just words I'm going , said. "I'll using notation called IBIS   issue based information system   capture discussion. IBIS three elements: issues, ideas arguments. I'll explain go along. OK   Let's get started figuring want discussion. What's aim?" asked. His starting spiel done, Jack glanced colleagues: Max seemed tad skeptical ; Rick ever bored; Andrew Mary stared screen. No one said anything. Just prompt asking another question, Mary said, "I'd say explore options implementing new system find suitable one. Phrased question: How implement system X?" Jack glanced others. They seemed agree   least, disagree   Mary, "Excellent," said, "I think good summary trying ." He drew question node map continued: "Most discussions kind aimed resolving issues questions. Our root question : What options implementing system X, Mary put , How implement System X." Figure 1 Figure 1 "So, next," asked Max. He still looked skeptical, Jack see intrigued. Not bad, thought  . "Well, next step explore ideas address resolve issue. So, ideas responses question: implement system X? Any suggestions?" "We'd engage consultants," said Max. "We -house skills implement ." Jack created idea node map began typing. "OK   hire consultants," said. He looked others continued, "In IBIS, ideas depicted light bulbs. Since ideas respond questions, I draw arrow idea root question, like : Figure 2 Figure 2 "I think option," said Mary, "We'd need training might take us longer learning job, viable option. " "Good," said Jack, "You've given us another option ways might go implementing option. Ideally, node represent single   atomic   point. So I'll capture said like ." He typed fast , drawing nodes filling detail. As wrote said, "Mary said   clearly new idea   implementation option. She also partly described might go : training learn technology learning job. I've added "How" question two points describe ideas responding question." He paused looked around check every one , continued. "But : also mentioned shortcoming   will take longer. I capture argument idea; con, depicted red minus map." He paused briefly look handiwork -screen, asked, "Any questions?" Figure 3 Figure 3 Rick asked, "Are rules governing nodes connected?" "Good question! In nutshell: ideas respond questions arguments respond ideas. Issues, hand, can generated type node. I can give links references Web interested." "That might useful everyone," said Andrew. "Send us." "Sure. Let's move . So, anyone options?" "Umm.. sure work, co-development?" Suggested Rick. "Do mean collaborative development external resources?" asked Jack began typing. "Yes," confirmed Rick. Figure 4 Figure 4 "What costs? We limited budget ," said Mary. "Good point," said Jack started typing. "This constraint must satisfied potential approaches." He stopped typing looked others, "This important: criteria apply potential approaches, criterial question hang root node," said. "Does make sense everyone?" Figure 5 Figure 5 "I'm sure I understand," said Andrew. "Why criteria separate approaches?" "They separate. They're level higher specific approach apply solutions. Put another way, relate root issue   How implement system X   rather specific solution." "Ah, makes sense," said Andrew. "This notation seems pretty powerful." "It , I'll happy show features later, continue discussion now. Are criteria?" "Well, must priority 1 features described scoping document implemented end year," said Andrew. One can always count manager emphasise constraints. "OK, two criteria actually: must implement priority 1 features must implement year end," said Jack, added new nodes. "No surprises ," continued, " three classic project constraints   budget, scope time." Figure 6 Figure 6 The others now engaged map, looking , making notes etc. Jack wanted avoid driving discussion, instead suggesting move things forward, asked, "What consider next?" "I think approaches," said Mary. Does anyone suggestions, look pros cons listed approaches?" "I've said ; I'll say : I think dum..,.sorry, good idea. It fraught much risk " started Max. "No ," countered Mary, " contrary, hiring externals risky costs can blowout much ." "Good points," said Jack, noted Mary's point. "Max, specific risks mind?" Figure 7 Figure 7 "Time   can take much longer," said Max. "We've already captured con -- approach," said Jack. "Hmm  true, I reword state hard deadline. Perhaps say   may finish allotted time   something similar." "That's good point," said Jack, changed node read: higher risk meeting deadline. The map coming along nicely now, full attention folks room. Figure 8 Figure 8 "Alright," continued, " cons? If , pros   arguments support approaches?" "That's easy, " said Mary, " will improve knowledge technology; able support maintain system ." "Doing consultants will enable us complete project quicker," countered Max. Jack added pros paused, giving group time reflect map. Figure 9 Figure 9 Rick Mary, sitting next , whispered side-conversation going; Andrew Max writing something . Jack waited. "Mary I idea," said Rick. "We take approach combines best worlds   external consultants internal resources. Actually, already got separate approach   co-development, discussed yet.." He group's attention now. "Co-development allows us use consultants' expertise really need develop skills . Yes, need put thought work, I think ." "I see co-development will reduce time risk   will take longer consultants." said Max. "True," said Mary, " better , important, enables us develop -house skills needed support maintain application. In long run, can add huge saving. Just last week I read maintenance can anywhere 60 80 percent total system costs." "So saying reduces implementation time results smaller exposure cost blowout?" asked Jack. "Yes," said Mary Jack added pros waited. Figure 10 Figure 10 "I still see reduces time," said Max. "It , compared option ," retorted Mary. "Wait second guys," said Jack. "What I reword pros read   Reduced implementation time compared -house option Reduced cost compared external option." He looked Mary Max.   seemed OK , typed changes. Figure 11 Figure 11 Jack asked, "So, issues, ideas arguments anyone like add?" "From map, seems co-development best option," said Andrew. He looked around see others thought: Rick Mary nodding; Max still looked doubtful. Max asked, " going figure ? It easy partition work cleanly teams different levels expertise." Jack typed con. Figure 12 Figure 12 "Good point," said Andrew. "There may ways address concern. Do think help brought consultants day-long engagement workshop co-development approach team? " Max nodded, "Yeah, might work," said. "It's worth try anyway. I reservations, co-development seems best three approaches." "Great," said Andrew, "I'll get consultants next week help us workshop approach." Jack typed exchange, others started gather things. "Anything else add?" asked. Everyone looked map. "No, , I think," said Mary. "Looks good," said Mike . "Be sure send us copy map." Figure 13 Figure 13 "Sure, I'll print copies right away," said Jack. "Since developed together, points disagreement." "That's true," said Andrew, "another good reason use tool." Gathering papers, asked, "Is anything else? He looked around table. " Alright , I'll see guys later, I'm get lunch next meeting." Jack looked around group. Helped along IBIS facilitation, overcome differences reached collective decision. He thought work, . " Jack, thanks help discussion. IBIS seems great way capture discussions. Don't forget send us references," said Mary, gathering notes. "I'll right away," said Jack, " I'll also send information Compendium   open-source software tool I used create map." "Great," said Mary. "I've got run. See later." "See later," replied Jack.
