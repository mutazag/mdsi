I've written number posts complexity projects, covering topics ranging conceptual issues models project complexity. Despite verbiage, I've never addressed key issue complexity handled. Methodologists claim, justification, complexity can tamed adequate planning together appropriate controlling monitoring project progresses. Yet, personal experience   accounts many others   suggests beast remains untamed. A weeks ago, I read brilliant series articles Paul Culmsee, discusses technique called Dialogue Mapping , among things, may prove dragon-slayer. In post I present overview technique illustrate utility real-life project situations. First brief history: dialogue mapping roots wicked problems   problems hard solve, even define, satisfy one criteria. (Note relationship problem wickedness project complexity: projects set address solve wicked problems generally complex converse necessarily true   see post ). Over three decades ago, Horst Rittel   man coined term "wicked problem"   colleague Werner Kunz developed technique called Issue Based Information System (IBIS) aid understanding problems. IBIS based premise wicked problems   contentious issues   can understood discussing terms three essential elements: issues ( questions), ideas ( answers) arguments ( ideas). IBIS subsequently refined years various research groups independent investigators. Jeff Conklin, inventor dialogue mapping, one main contributors effort. Now, beauty IBIS easy learn. Basically three elements mentioned earlier   issues, ideas arguments   can connected ways specified IBIS grammar. The elements syntax language can illustrated half page   I shall minute. Before , I mention excellent, free software tool   Compendium   supports IBIS notation. I use discussion demo . I recommend download install Compendium proceeding . Go , I'll wait   OK, begin. IBIS three elements illustrated Compendium map : IBIS Elements Figure 1: IBIS Elements The elements : Question: issue discussed analysed. Note term "question" synonymous "issue" Idea: response question. An idea responds question sense offers potential resolution clarification question. Argument: argument favour idea ( pro con) The arrows show links relationships elements. That's far elements IBIS concerned. The IBIS grammar specifies legal ways elements can linked. The rules nicely summarised following diagram: Figure 2: Legal Links IBIS Figure 2: Legal Links IBIS In nutshell, rules : Any element (question, idea agument) can questioned. Ideas respond questions. Arguments make case ideas. Note questions argued! Simple, ? Essentially IBIS. So IBIS got dialogue mapping? Well, dialogue mapping facilitation group discussion using shared display   display everyone participating discussion can see add . Typically facilitator drives   .e. modifies display   seeking input participants, using IBIS notation capture issues, ideas arguments come . . This synchronous, real-time, application IBIS described Conklin's book, Dialogue Mapping: Building Shared Understanding Wicked Problems (An absolute must-read manage complex projects diverse stakeholders). For completeness, worth pointing IBIS can also used asynchronously   example, dissecting arguments presented papers articles. This application IBIS   essentially dialogue mapping minus facilitation   sometimes called issue mapping. I now describe simple realistic application dialogue mapping, adapted real-life case. For brevity, I reproduce entire dialogue. Instead I'll describe dialogue map develops discussion progresses. The example simple illustration IBIS can used facilitate shared understanding ( solution) problem. All set? OK, go  The situation: Our finance data mart updated overnight batch job takes hours. This good enough purposes. However, small ( vocal!) number users need able report transactions occurred within last hour   waiting next day, especially month-end, simply option. The dev team figure best way . The location: office. The players: two colleagues IT, one finance, . The shared display: Compendium running computer, visible players. The discussion launched issue stated -front: How update data mart business hours? My colleagues dev team came several ideas address issue. After capturing issue responding ideas, map looked like : Figure 3: Map - stage 1 Figure 3: Map - stage 1 In brief, options : Use messaging infrastructure carry update. Write database triggers transaction tables. These triggers update data mart tables directly indirectly. Write custom T-SQL procedures ( SSIS package) carry update ( database SQL Server 2005). Run relevant (already existing) Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) procedures frequent intervals   possibly several times day. As discussion progressed, developers raised arguments ideas. A little later map looked like : Figure 4: Map - stage 2 Figure 4: Map - stage 2 Note data latency refers time interval transaction occurs propagation data mart, complexity rough measure effort required ( time) implement option. I go arguments detail, largely self-explanatory. The business rep asked often ETL run. "The relevant portions can run hourly, really want ," replied ETL queen. "That's good enough," said business rep.  voilà, solution! The final map looked much like previous one: additions business rep's question, developer's response node marking decision made: Figure 5: Final Map Figure 5: Final Map Note decision node simply idea accepted ( parties) decision issue discussed. Admittedly, little example nowhere near complex project. However, dismissing outright, consider following benefits afforded process dialogue mapping: Everyone's point view taken account. The shared display served focal point discussion: entire group contributed development map. Further, points arguments made represented map. The display discussion around ensured common ( shared) understanding problem. Once shared understanding achieved   business IT case   solution almost obvious. The finished map serves intuitive summary discussion   participant can go back recall essential structure discussion way almost impossible written document. If think tall claim, challenge: try reconstructing meeting written minutes. Enough said, I think. But perhaps simple example leaves unconvinced. If , I urge read Jeff Conklin's reflections "industrial strength" case-study dialogue mapping. Despite limited practical experience technique, I believe useful way address issues arise complex projects, particularly involving stakeholders diverse points view. That's say panacea project complexity   , nothing . From purely pragmatic perspective, may viewed addition project manager's tool-chest communication techniques. For, I've noted elsewhere, "A shared world-view   includes common understanding tools, terminology, culture, politics etc.   enables effective communication within (project) group." Dialogue mapping provides practical means achieve shared understanding.
