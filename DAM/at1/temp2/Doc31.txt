System design creative activity, one subject variety constraints. Many constraints obvious: example, tasked designing new software product, team might asked work within budget use particular technology. These constraints place boundaries design activity; force designers work within parameters specified constraints. But less obvious constraints . In paper entitled, How Do Committees Invent, published 1968, Melvin Conway described notion now called Conway's Law: An organisation designs system will inevitably produce design mirrors organisation's communication structure. This post summary key points paper. Conway begins paper observation system design activity involves specifying system will built using number diverse parts. Many elements act design similar, regardless nature system   software shopping mall. The objective design team organisation produce specification blueprint based system can built. Much design work making choices. Conway points choices may design decisions: Most design activity requires continually making choices. Many choices may design decisions; may also personal decisions designer makes future. As shall see later, incentives exist conventional management environment can motivate choices subvert intent sponsor. The paper essentially elaboration justification claim. Pre-design work The preliminary stages design work organizing design . First, boundaries understood solution space can defined. Second, high-level structure system explored work can subdivided sensible way within organisation design. This latter point crux Conway's argument:   act organizing design team means certain design decisions already made, explicitly otherwise. Given design team organization, class design alternatives effectively pursued organization necessary communication paths exist. Therefore, thing design group organized unbiased. There couple important points : The act delegating design tasks narrows scope design options can pursued. Once tasks delegated groups, coordination (via communication) groups way work can integrated. Further, established, hard change design idea ( project team, matter). The system mirrors organisation Most systems significance composed several subsystems communicate via interfaces. According Conway, elements (italicized previous sentence) correspondence organisation designs system. How ? Well, every subsystem designed group within organisation (call design group). If two subsystems communicate interact , two groups responsible design must communicate ( negotiate interface design). If subsystems interact, communication necessary. What see argument communication subsystems roughly mirrors communication paths within organisation. As system designer knows: given set requirements, number designs can satisfy . If argument previous paragraph true structure design organisation ( project team) influences choice made. Managing systems design Conway points large system design efforts spin control often small systems. He surmises happens design becomes complex one person ( small, tightly-knit group people). A standard management reaction situation delegate design component sub-teams. Why? Well Conway says: A manager knows will vulnerable charge mismanagement misses schedule without applied resources. This knowledge creates strong pressure initial designer might prefer wrestle design rather fragment delegation, made feel cost risk high take chance. Therefore, forced delegate order bring resources bear. A major fallacy line thinking resources means work gets done faster. It well known   least far software systems development concerned. Conway points politics also contributes effect. In organisations, managerial status tied team size project budgets. This provides incentive managers expand organisations (.e. project teams), making design delegation almost inevitable. Large teams large number communication paths members. Specifically, team consisting N people, N(N-1)/2 possible communication paths   person can communicate N-1 people making N(N-1), halved paths every two individuals counted twice. Organisations deal restricting communication paths hierarchical management structures. Because communication paths mirror organizational structures, almost inevitable system designs will mirror . Conclusion The main implication Conway's thesis project team ( organisation) charged designing system structured way suits communication needs system. For example, sub-teams involved designing related subsystems many communication channels design independent components. Further, system design inherently complex, first design almost never final one. A consequence flows design organisations flexible almost always need reorganized. In end less number people team communication . As Conway mentions last two lines paper: There need philosophy system design management based assumption adding manpower simply adds productivity. The development philosophy promises unearth basic questions value resources techniques communication will need answered system-building technology can proceed confidence. This true now forty-odd years ago.
