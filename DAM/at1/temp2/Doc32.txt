Most research practice literature project management tends view projects isolated environment. It obvious anyone worked project . In view , useful look relationship projects organisations host . This post looks issue, drawing paper Gernot Grabher entitled, Cool Projects, Boring Institutions: Temporary Collaboration Social Context. The emergence projects Grabher begins discussion sketch projects emerged distinct work form. Projects   .e. time bound, goal focused activities   always around. The modern notion project, however, arose development philosophy came US Department Defense 1950s. He states,  Instead fragmenting pre-specifying development military technologies along functional disciplines, technologies described relation objectives, .e. military parameters weapons. The pacing concentrated efforts crucial: parameters met, goals accomplished according grand scheme (program?) win armament race. Development processes earlier seen separate activities now conceptualized integrated entity called program, system project. The overwhelming scale projects terms financial scientific resources well ambitious timing created formidable problems coordination control. Experiments various forms organizational control ultimately lead professionalization role project manager  From thereon concepts projects project management taken ( much enthusiasm optimism) business industry. The formalization various project management methodologies, standards , qualifications trade journals can seen culmination process. Given military-industrial origins profession, easy see "command control" philosophy dominates much project management thought practice. Many early projects paraded textbook examples successful projects operated outside normal organizational oversight. They , large extent, deliberately shielded external influences. I believe isolation environment seen Good Thing project managers   problems coordination control become much simpler one manage relationships politics (perceived ) external project. This practice may necessary workable classified projects run billion dollar budgets, work well environments project managers work . Projects take place vacuum; born, live die real-world organizations. To forget see "tree project" miss "forest organization." This particularly , unlike near-mythical mega-projects 1950s, efforts I work deeply entwined hosting organizations. Organisation-related characteristics projects Grabher notes characteristics projects. I summarize next paragraphs. First, interesting original meaning word "project" referred "proposal" "idea", rather "directed, time-bound effort." Grabher points shift meaning accompanied shift focus: project idea ( goal) project process ( means achieving goal). Projects thus seen vehicles achieving organisational goals. Second, Grabher notes projects often hard decompose constituent tasks, (commonly agreed) decomposition possible stakeholders interrelate continually. This underscores importance communication projects. Third, Grabher highlights importance project manager ( uses term contractor) "lynchpin trust focused." The role manager particularly important projects team members time get know well. Fourth, project manager / contractor also wielder organizational authority far project concerned. He , sense, representative organization   person whose presence underlines fact project exists achieve specified organizational goals. Finally, deadlines defining aspect projects. They serve several functions. For example, ensure sense urgency action progress remains duration project. They also might serve legitimize execution project work without external interference ( argument frequently used military-industrial projects 1950s). But , final deadline, culminates termination project, also serves connector rest organization. It time handoffs, documentation, team disbanding etc. occurs, thus enabling results experiences project disperse wider organization. Projects organisations The characteristics noted highlight dual nature projects: one hand, noted earlier, projects seen semi-autonomous temporary organisations, also firmly embedded within hosting organisation. An effect latter particularly evident consulting software services firms ( even corporate IT shops), tend similar projects . As Grabher notes, [projects] apparently operate milieu recurrent collaboration , several project cycles, fills pool resources gels latent networks. Project organising mostly directed towards actual realization potential generated reproduced practice drawing core members (successful) prior projects serve derivative successor projects. Such chains repeated co-operation held together ( cut ) reputation members gain ( lose) previous collaborations  Another aspect embedded-ness co-location team members within larger organizational milieu. The standard benefits co-location well known. These : Savings transactional costs incurred communication, supervision staff remote locations etc. See post transaction cost view outsourcing . Co-location improves efficacy communication encouraging face--face interactions. It enables "near real-time" monitoring health project environment. There's though. Grabher notes addition "intentional" "strategic" benefits, co-location also ensures team members exposed organizational noise   consists "concoction rumours, impressions, recommendations, trade folklore strategic misinformation (falsehoods!)." Co-location enables project teams make collective sense organisational noise   shared understanding environment can contribute significantly creation team spirit. A related notionis enculturation: , process becoming accepted member group, insider. This less expertise knowledge learning unspoken rules norms community. Although becoming member community much social interactions within workplace, : lot essential know- know- transferred informal interactions senior members team ( often senior members organisation) others. Projects generally need draw upon range organizational resources: people physical infrastructure obvious ones. Grabher notes increasing projectisation organizations can attributed perception project-based management efficient way allocate productive resources flexible manner ( whether perception correct, another matter altogether). However, less obvious influences organisations exert . For example, Grabher points organizational norms rules provide basis emergence swift trust, trust based roles professional ability rather individuals personalities. Further, higher level, organizational culture plays role determining project governed, managed run. These explicit implicit norms stabilising influence projects. In addition stabilizing influence hosting organisation, projects also offer opportunities build enhance links organisations   instance, strategic partnerships. This , effect, institution building aimed leveraging strengths participating organisations greater joint benefit. In situations participating organisations take role "lynchpins" trust focused. Grabher makes point firms ( institutions comprised firms) provide resources make projects possible, also host range processes needed organize run projects. For one, projects usually preceded several organisational processes involving deliberation, selection preparation. These activities occur project happen, normally fall outside purview project. A somewhat paradoxical aspect projects although offer opportunity enhancing organizational knowledge, rarely happens practice. The high pressure environment projects leaves little time formal training informal learning, even capture knowledge documents. To large extent hosting organisations blame: Grabher suggests paradox consequence lack organizational redundancy project-based organizing. I'll end section observation social dimension projects often neglected. Projects often hindered organizational politics inertia. Further, large number projects fail varying perceptions project goals rationale behind . Although seems obvious project proceed unless stakeholders shared understanding objectives reasons , surprising many projects drift along without . Many project planners neglect issue, invariably comes back bite . Conclusions In conclusion paper, Grabher states: The formation operation projects essentially relies societal infrastructure built around networks, localities, institutions firms. Relations temporary permanent systems matter straightforward substitution regarded terms interdependence. ‘Cool' projects, indeed, rely ‘boring' institutions  This unarguable, also kept mind projects often subject negative organisational influences can slow , even kill altogether ( perhaps early defence projects set near-autonomous initiatives). So although true projects made possible sustained organisations embedded , sometimes hindered organisations . To sum line: Projects depend organisations material human resources, also draw sustenance ( affected ) social environment culture exists within organisations.
