The fundamental premise behind best practices possible reproduce successes excel imitating . At first sight assumption seems obvious uncontroversial. However, people lived implementation best practice know following prescriptions guarantee success. Actually, anecdotal evidence suggests contrary: attempts implementing best practices fail. This paradox remains unnoticed managers executives continue commit organisations implementing best practices , best, dubious value. Why best practices fail? There fair bit research shortcomings best practices, one thing tells us simple answer question. In post I'll discuss issue, drawing upon old ( still relevant) paper Jonathan Wareham Han Cerrits entitled, De-Contextualising Competence: Can Best Practice Bundled Sold. Note I will cover paper entirety; discussion will focus aspects relate question raised . I may well say : I secondary aim ( accurately, vested interest) discussing paper. Over last months Paul Culmsee I working book discusses reasons best practices fail proposes practical techniques address shortcomings. I'll end post brief discussion background content book (see post Paul's take book). But look paper first  Background On first page paper authors state: Although concept ‘imitating excellent performers' may seem quite banal first glance, issue, will argue, altogether simple deeper consideration. Accordingly, purpose paper explore many fundamental, often unquestioned, assumptions underlie philosophy application Business Best Practice transfer. In illuminating central empirical theoretical problems emerging discipline, hope refine expectations technique can yield, well contribute theory improvement practice. One valuable aspects paper lists implicit assumptions often glossed consultants others sell implement best practice methodologies. It turns assumptions valid practical situations, renders practices worthless. The implicit assumptions According Wareham Cerrits, unstated premises behind best practices include: Homogeneity organisations: Most textbooks courses best practices present practices though existence independent organizational context. Put another way: assume organisations essentially . Clearly, case   organisations defined differences. Universal yardstick: Best practices assume universal definition best, best one best others. This assumption clearly false organisations different (dare I say, unique) environments, objectives strategies. How can universal definition "best" fit ? Transferability: Another tacit assumption best practice business practices can transplanted receiving organisations wholesale. Sure, recent years recognized transplants successful ) recipient organisation undertakes changes necessary transplant work b) practice adapted recipient organisation. The point successful cases, change adaptation great longer resembles original best practice. This important point   hope hell working, best practices adapted extensively. It also worth mentioning adaptations will succeed made consultation will affected practices. I'll say later post Alienability stickiness: These concepts relate possibility extracting relevant knowledge pertaining best practice source transferring without change recipient. Alienability refers possibility extracting relevant knowledge source. Alienability difficult best practice knowledge often tacit, therefore difficult codify. Stickiness refers willingness recipient learn knowledge, ability absorb . Stickiness highlights importance obtaining employee buy- implementing best practices. Unfortunately best practice implementations gloss issues alienability stickiness. Validation: Wareham Cerrits contend best practices rarely validated. More often , recipient organisations simply believe will work, based consultants' marketing spiel. See short piece Paul Strassman dangers . What "best" mean anyway? After listing implicit assumptions, Wareham Cerrits argue conceptual basis defining particular practice "best" weak. Their argument hinges observation impossible attribute superior performance firm specific managerial practices. Why? Well, one perform control experiment see happen practices used. Related somewhat subtle point impossible say, certainty, whether practices, exist within model organisations, consequences well-thought managerial action whether merely adaptations changing environments. If latter true, best practice, practices exist model organisations essentially random responses organizational stimuli. Wareham Cerrits also present economic perspective best practice acquisition transfer, I'll omit direct relevance question best practices fail. Implications The authors draw following conclusions analysis: The definition best practices fraught pitfalls. Environmental factors significant effect evolution transfer(ability) "best" practices. Consequently, works one organisation may work another. So, can anything salvaged? Wareham Cerrits think . They suggest expanded view best practices includes things : Using best practices guides learning new technologies new ways working. Using best practices generate creative insight business processes work practice. Using best practices guide change   , following high-level steps, necessarily detailed prescriptions. These indeed sensible reasonable statements. However, much weaker usual hyperbole-laden claims accompany best practices. Discussion Cerrits Johnson focus practices , problems used solve. In opinion, another key reason best practices fail applied without comprehensive understanding problem intended address. I'll clarify using example: quest improve efficiency organisation might go major restructure. All often, organisations will think consequences restructuring ( long-term consequences outsourcing certain functions, instance). The important point realize comprehensive understanding consequences possible stakeholders   management employees   involved planning restructure. Unfortunately, bottom- approach rarely taken effort involved, wrong-headed perception chaos may ensue management actually talking people metaphorical shop floor. So organizations take top- approach, dictating will done, little employee involvement. Organisations focus achieve particular end. The end , reasons wanting achieve consequences remain unexplored; assumed obvious stakeholders. To put aphoristically: organizations focus "" "" ." The heart matter The key understanding best practices work realise many organizational problems wicked problems: .e., problems hard define, let alone solve's (see paper comprehensive discussion wicked problems). Let's look organizational efficiency, example. What really mean improve organizational efficiency? More point, can one arrive generally agreed way improve organizational efficiency? By generally agreed, I mean measure stakeholders understand agree . Note "efficiency " just example   holds matters strategic importance organizations: organisational strategy wicked problem. Since wicked problems hard pin ( mean different things different people), first step solving ensure stakeholders common ( shared) understanding problem . The next step achieve shared commitment solving problem. Any technique help achieve shared understanding wicked problems commitment solving truly deserve called one best practice rule . The genesis collaboration About year ago, series landmark posts entitled The One Best Practice Rule Them All, Paul Culmsee wrote search practical method manage wicked problems. In articles made convincing case dialogue mapping can help diverse group stakeholders achieve shared understanding problems. Paul's writings inspired learn dialogue mapping use work. I impressed   , finally, technique claim best practice, potential address really complex problems organisations face. Since , Paul I several conversations failure best practices tackling issues ranging organizational change project management. Paul one rare practitioners excellent grounding theory practice. I learnt lot conversations. Among things, told experiences using dialogue mapping tackle apparently intractable problems (see case study Paul's company, example). Late last year, thought writing things talking series joint blog posts. Soon realised much say fit series posts   probably enough book. We're months writing book, quite pleased way turning . Here's brief summary book. The first part analyses best practices fail. Our analysis touches upon diverse areas like organizational rhetoric, cognitive bias, memetics scientific management (topics Paul I written blogs). The second part book presents series case studies illustrate techniques address complex problems organizations face. The case studies based experiences using dialogue mapping techniques tackle wicked problems relating organizational strategy project management. The techniques discuss go beyond rhetoric best practices   work use bottom- approach takes account context environment problems live. Now, Paul writes way better I . For one, writing laugh--loud funny, mine . Those read work mine may wondering different styles will combine. I'm delighted report book way conversational entertaining blog posts. However, I also emphasise trying rigorous can backing claims references research papers / case studies. We're learning lot process writing, enthused excited book . Please stay tuned   post occasional updates progressing.
