I've written number articles project failure, covering topics ranging definitions success role biases project failure. As interesting issues , somewhat removed day--day concerns project manager interested avoiding failure defining analyzing . In paper entitled, Early warning signs IT project failure: dominant dozen, Leon Kappelman et. al. outline top twelve risks associated IT project failures. This post summarises paper lists top twelve signs impending trouble projects. Background research methodology The authors focus early warning signs   .e. occur within initial 20% planned schedule. Further, ensure comprehensive coverage risks, conclusions based inputs academic industry journals well experienced IT project managers. The paper provides detailed explanation research methodology, I'll quote directly paper: The research team first searched literature extensively develop preliminary list early warning signs (EWSs). The two authors experienced IT project management added several EWSs based personal experience. Next, 19 IT project management experts asked assess list. On basis feedback, added new items modified others develop list 53 EWSs. Finally, research team invited 138 experienced IT project managers (including original 19 experts) participate rating 53 EWSs using scale 1 (extremely unimportant) 7 (extremely important). Fifty-five (55) managers completed survey, yielding response rate nearly 40 percent. The respondents average 15 years IT project management experience. The budgets largest IT projects managed ranged 3 million 7 billion dollars. About 30 percent held title program project manager nearly 20 percent consultant titles. Director program analyst titles accounted 15 percent , 10 percent vice presidents, rest held titles CEO, CIO, chief scientist, chief technologist, partner. Although list rankings based subjective opinions experts, large number participants ensures degree consensus regarding important factors. The troublesome twelve After ranking fifty odd risks, authors focused scores 6 ( maximum possible 7 discussed ). There 17 risks satisfied (somewhat arbitrary) criterion. Some similar, combined. For example, four risks: No documented milestone deliverables due dates. No project status progress process Schedule deadline reconciled project schedule Early project delays ignored — revision overall project schedule combined : ineffective schedule planning / management. This process combining top 17 items resulted twelve risks, half turned people-related half process-related. I discuss risks detail . People-related early warning signs 1. Lack top management support: This number one risk fifty three authors listed. This surprising   project lacks executive support unlikely get financial, material human resources necessary make happen. 2. Ineffective project manager: Project managers lack communication managerial skills needed move project ahead pose serious risk projects. The authors point common risk IT projects project managers often technical folks promoted managers. As may lack interest, aptitude / skills manage projects. Interestingly, authors comment converse problem   whether project manager's lack technical/domain knowledge contributes project failure. 3. No stakeholder involvement / participation: A large number projects proceed minimal involvement key stakeholders. Such folks often lose interest projects immediate matters consume attention. In situations project manager may find hard get resources needs get project done. Stakeholder sponsor apathy obvious warning sign project headed trouble. 4. Uncommitted project team: The commitment (preferably, full-time) team essential success project. Management needs ensure team members given time ( incentives) work project. A point often left unconsidered intrinsic motivation team   see post detailed discussion motivation project management. 5. Lack technical knowledge/skills: Project teams need technical skills knowledge relevant project. Managers sometimes wrongly assume project staff can pick required skills whilst working project. Another common management misconception project personnel can master new technologies solely attending training courses. Getting contractors work one solution problem. However, best option give team enough time get familiar technology prior project , failing , switch technology team familiar . 6. Subject matter experts available: It often assumed subject matter experts can provide adequate inputs projects whilst regular jobs. This seldom works   choice project jobs, latter always wins. Project sponsors need ensure subject matter experts freed work project. Process-related early warning signs 1. Unclear scope: The authors label one "Lack documented requirements / success criteria." However I think better described phrase I've used. All project management methodologies emphasise importance clear, well-documented requirements success criteria   good reason . Lack clarity regarding project scope means one knows project headed   sure sign trouble ahead. 2. No change control process: As cliché reminds us, change constant business environments. It therefore inevitable project scope will change. Changes scope  however minor may seem- need assessed impact project. The effect several small (unanalyzed) scope changes project schedule underestimated! Many project managers hard time pushing back scope changes foisted senior executives. Hence important change control process applies across board   everyone regardless authority. 3. Ineffective scheduling schedule management: Many schedules built little guesswork unhealthy dose optimism, often drawn without input folks 'll actually work (see article estimation errors ). Schedules need rooted reality. For happen, must based reliable estimates, preferably responsible creating deliverables. Once schedule created, project manager's responsibility update continually, reflecting detours road-bumps occurred along way. A common failing time overruns properly recorded, leading false illusion progress. 4. Communication breakdown: Project communication art getting people page reading different books. In post obstacles project communication, I discussed generic difficulties posed differences stakeholder backgrounds world-views. One key responsibilities project manager ensure everyone project shared understanding project goals shared commitment achieving . This true middle end project start. 5. Resources assigned another project: In experience resources rarely reassigned wholesale projects. What usually happens reassigned part time basis, " take 20 % Matt's time 10% Nick's time." The problem Matt Nick will end spending time project, leaving one hand bereft. 6. No business case: A uncommon refrain corporate hallways , "Why project?" No project given go-ahead without well-articulated business case. Further still, since understanding reason(s) project central success, made available every stakeholder: shared understanding goals project prerequisite shared understanding rationale behind . I'm sure surprises list   project managers agree indeed common ( often ignored) early warning signs failure. However, I suspect will substantial differences opinion regarding ranking. Wisely, authors refrained attempting rank risks   list order importance. Conclusion Good projects managers anticipate potential problems take action avoid . Although risks listed indeed obvious , often ignored. Affected projects limp oblivion responsible failed react portents trouble. Granted, can hard see problems within system, particularly system high-pressure project. That's lists useful: can warn project manager potential trouble ahead.
