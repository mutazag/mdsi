Risk management important component project management frameworks methodologies, project managers well aware need manage risks projects. However, books training courses offer little guidance relative importance different categories risks. One useful way look risks whether pose operational strategic threats. The former category includes risks impact project execution latter affect project goals. A recent paper entitled, Categorising Risks Seven Large Projects   Which Risks Projects Focus On?, looks strategic operational risks treated typical, real-life projects. This post summary review paper. Operational strategic risks For purpose study, authors paper categorise risks follows: Operational risk: A risk affects project deliverable. Short term strategic risk: A risk impacts expected outcome project. That , results expected directly deliverable. For example, order processing system (deliverable) might expected reduce processing time 50% average (outcome). Long term strategic risk: A risk affects strategic goal project intended address. For example, expected strategic outcome new order processing system might boost sales 25% next 2 years. It also necessary define unambiguous criteria risks can assigned one categories. The authors use following criteria classify risks: A risk operational risk can impact deliverable set project definition (scope document, charter etc.) delivery contract. A risk short-term strategic can effect functionality clearly mentioned project documentation, required order achieve project objectives. A risk considered long-term strategic affects long-term goals project fall prior two categories. The authors use third category catch- bucket risks fall first two categories. Methodology The authors collected data risk registers seven large projects. Prior data collection, conducted interviews relevant project personnel get understanding goals context project. Further interviews conducted, needed, mainly clarify points came analysis. A point note projects studied progress, different phases ranging initiation closure. Results discussion The authors' findings can summed line: overwhelming majority risks operational. The fraction risks classified long-term strategic less 0.5 % total ( 1300 risks classified ). Why number strategic risks low? The authors offer following reasons: Strategic risks occur project progress: The authors argue plausible strategic risks ( ) handled prior project given go-ahead. This makes sense, well-vetted project strategic risks will occur substantial changes hosting organisation / environment. Long term strategic risks project's responsibility: This view taken project management methodologies: project exists achieve stated objectives; long-term impact irrelevant. Put another way, focus efficiency, (organisational) effectiveness (I'll say future post). The authors recommend project risk managers need aware strategic issues, even though traditionally purview project. Why? Well, issues can major impact project perceived organisation. Strategic risks mainly asset owner's ( sponsor's) responsibility: According conventional management wisdom strategic risks responsibility management, project team. In contrast, authors suggest project team perhaps better placed identify strategic risks long come management's attention. From personal experience I can vouch true, add can difficult raise awareness risks politically acceptable way. Conclusion The main point article makes strategic risks, though often ignored, can huge effect projects viewed larger organisation. It therefore important risks identified escalated sponsors decision makers timely manner. This message organisations well heed, particularly "shoot messenger" culture discourages honest open communication risks.
