conventional approaches knowledge management projects focus cognitive thoughtrelated mechanical aspects knowledge creation capture there alternate view one considers knowledge created interactions people interactions develop mutually acceptable interpretations theories facts ways suit particular needs that project knowledge socially constructed if true project managers need pay attention environmental social factors influence knowledge construction this position taken paul jackson jane klobas paper entitled building knowledge projects a practical application social constructivism information systems development presents knowledge creation sharing process model based social constructivist theory this article summary review paper a social constructivist view knowledge jackson klobas begin observation engineering disciplines founded belief knowledge can expressed propositions correspond reality independent human perception however alternate view knowledge absolute relative ie depends mental models beliefs used interpret facts objects events a relevant example software product viewed business users software developers the former group may see application terms utility whereas latter may see instance particular technology such perception gaps can also occur within seemingly homogenous groups teams comprised software developers example this can happen variety reasons differences experience cultural backgrounds make group social constructivism looks gaps can bridged the authors discussion relies work berger luckmann described gap perceptions different individuals can overcome create socially constructed shared reality the phrase socially constructed implies reality pertains project example created via common understanding issues followed mutual agreement players comprises reality for view strikes particular chord akin stated aims dialogue mapping technique i described several earlier posts see article example relevant projects knowledge information systems development social construct first authors make point information systems development isd projects  intensive exercises constructing social reality process data modeling these models informed particular worldview systems designers use particular formal representations in isd projects operational reality new explicitly constructed becomes understood accepted negotiated agreement participants two cultures business it essentially knowledge emerges interaction discussion project proceeds however methodologies used design typically founded engineering approach takes positivist view rather social one as authors suggest perhaps social constructivist paradigm offers insight continuing failure namely happening isd project far complex simple translation description external reality instructions computer it emergence articulation multiple indeterminate sometimes unconscious sometimes ineffable realities negotiated achievement consensus new agreed reality explicit form business data model amenable computerization with mind authors aim develop model addresses shortcomings traditional positivist view knowledge isd projects they representing berger luckmanns theory social constructivism terms knowledge process model they identify management principles map processes these principles form basis survey used operational version process model the operational model assessed experts tested project manager reallife project the knowledge creationsharing process model the process model jackson klobas describe based berger luckmanns work figure knowledge creationsharing model figure knowledge creationsharing model the model describes personal knowledge created personal knowledge individual knows personal knowledge built using mental models world models frameworks individuals use make sense world according jacksonklobas process model personal knowledge built number process including internalisation the absorption knowledge individual knowledge creation the construction new knowledge repetitive performance tasks learning skills becoming aware new ideas ways thinking frameworks the latter corresponds learning concepts theories even new ways perceiving world these correspond change subjective reality individual externalisation the representation description knowledge using speech symbols can perceived internalized others think explaining ideas procedures individuals objectivation the creation shared constructs represent groups understanding world at point knowledge objectified perceived existence independent individuals legitimation the authorization objectified knowledge correct standard reification the process objective knowledge assumes status makes difficult change challenge a familiar example reified knowledge procedure process hardened system thats just way things done around common response processes challenged the links depicted figure show relationships processes jackson klobas suggest knowledge creation isd projects social process occurs continual communication business it sure elements knowledge creation design prototyping development learning new skills etc amount nought unless discussed argued agreed communicated social interactions these interactions occur wider context organization reasonable claim resulting knowledge takes form mirrors social environment organization clearly model knowledge creation different usual interpretation knowledge independent reality regardless whether known group an operational model the good theory makes interesting academic discussions what practice can model operationalised jackson klobas describe approach creating testing utility rather validity model i discuss following sections knowledge sharing heuristics to begin surveyed literature knowledge management identify knowledge sharing heuristics ie experiencebased techniques enable knowledge sharing as example heuristics associated externalization process we standard documentation modelling tools make business requirements easy understand stakeholders is staff communicate regularly direct facetoface contact we use prototypes the authors identified heuristics each matched process model according authors matching process simple cases doubt process heuristic attached this suggests model provides natural way organize voluminous complex body research knowledge creation sharing why important well suggests conceptual model illustrated fig can form basis simple means assess knowledge creation sharing capabilities work environments assurance relevant variables covered validating mapping the validity matching checked using twenty historical case studies isd projects this worked follows explanations worked well didnt mapped model process areas using heuristics identified prior step the aim answer question relationship project failure problems respective knowledge processes conversely project success presence positive indicators one case studies authors use wellknown possibly overanalysed failure automated dispatch system london ambulance service the paper succinct summary case study i reproduce the london ambulance service las largest ambulance service world provides accident emergency patient transport services resident population nearly seven million people their isd project intended produce automated system dispatch ambulances emergencies the existing manual system poor cumbersome inefficient relatively unreliable the goal new system provide efficient command control process overcome deficiencies furthermore system seen management opportunity resolve perceived issues poor industrial relations outmoded work practices low resource utilization a tender let development system components including computer aided dispatch automatic vehicle location radio interfacing mobile data terminals update status callout the tender let company inexperienced large systems delivery whilst project profound implications work practices personnel hardly involved design system upon implementation many errors software infrastructure led critical operational shortcomings failure calls reach ambulances the system lasted week necessary revert manual system jackson klobas show conceptual model maps knowledgerelated factors may played role failure project for example heading personal knowledge one can identify least two potential factors lack involvement endusers design selection inexperienced vendor further disconnect management employees suggests couple factors relating reification mutual negative perceptions outmoded unchallenged work practices from validation authors suggest model provides comprehensive framework explains projects failed that may overstating case whats cause whats effect hard tell especially fact nonetheless model seem able capture many knowledgerelated gaps played role failures further looking heuristics mapped process one might able suggest ways deficiencies addressed for example externalization problem area one might suggest use prototypes encourage face face communication is business personnel surveybased tool encouraged authors created survey tool intended evaluate knowledge creationsharing effectiveness project environments in tool academic terms used model translated everyday language example term externalization translated knowledge sharing see fig translated terms the tool asked project managers evaluate project environments knowledge creation process capability scale based inputs recommend specific improvement strategies capabilities scored low the tool evaluated four project managers used work environment period weeks at end period interviewed responses analysed using content analysis match experiences requirements designed intent tool unfortunately paper provide details tool difficult say much paraphrase authors comments based evaluation authors conclude tool provides a common framework project managers discuss issues pertaining knowledge creation sharing a means identify potential problems might done address field testing one evaluators model tested tool field the tester project manager wanted identify knowledge creationsharing deficiencies work environment ways addressed he answered questions based evaluation knowledge sharing capabilities environment developed improvement plan based strategies suggested tool along ideas the completed survey plan returned researchers use tool revealed following knowledge creationsharing deficiencies project managers environment inadequate personal knowledge ineffective externalization inadequate standardization objectivation strategies suggested tool include an internet portal promote knowledge capture sharing this included discussion forums areas capture discuss best practices etc role playing workshops reveal processes worked practice ie surface tacit knowledge based authors suggest technology can used promote support knowledge sharing standardization just storage interventions make tacit knowledge explicit can helpful as side benefit note survey raised consciousness knowledge creationsharing within team reflections conclusions in opinion value paper lies model survey tool conceptual framework underpins namely idea knowledge depends shaped social environment evolves perhaps example might help clarify means consider organisation decides implement project management best practices described fill popular methodologies the wrong way implement practices wholesale without regard organizational culture norms preexisting practices such approach unlikely lead imposed practices taking root organisation on hand approach picks practices useful tailors organizational needs constraints culture likely meet success the second approach works attempts bridge gap ideal best practice social reality organisation it encourages employees adapt practices ways make sense context organization this invariably involves modifying practices sometimes substantially creating new socially constructed knowledge bargain another interesting point authors make several knowledge sharing heuristics i think number classified unambiguously one processes model this suggests model reasonable view knowledge creationsharing process if one accepts conclusion model indeed provide common framework discussing issues relating knowledge creation project environments further associated heuristics can help identify processes dont work well im unable judge usefulness surveybased tool developed authors provide much detail paper however isnt really issue field project management many tools techniques anyway the key message paper opinion every project unique context techniques used others interpreted applied ways meaningful context particular project the paper excellent counterpoint methodologyoriented practice knowledge management projects required reading methodologists project managers believe things need done the book regardless social organizational context
