over last two decades recognized creativity innovation tend thrive organisations employees say decisions affect work this lead notion postbureaucratic organisation organisation decisions made collectively dialogue consensus hierarchy flat although number workgroups within large organizations function way success postbureaucratic organisation generally seen utopian academic ideal one unlikely work real world those manage organizations departments workgroups generally uncomfortable employees working autonomously even though might lead generation novel ideas products this understandable ultimately responsibility managers ensure organisational departmental goals achieved how else timetested command control approach management in response question posed project management often touted means manage creative innovative efforts organisations see articles issue pm network example the claim seems reasonable one project management definition provides means manage collective goal oriented endeavours further many projects especially involving new product software development creativeinnovative component in practice though project management tends bureaucratic affair involving plans must followed schedules must adhered regular progress reports must made even perhaps many organizations see project management means manage creative work postbureaucratic setting implicit view assumption implementation project management processes will enable managers control direct creative work without adverse sideeffects an article damian hodgson entitled project work the legacy bureaucratic control postbureaucratic organisation explores tensions contradictions presented notion although article written ago i believe ideas explored ever relevant today particularly view increasing projectisation organisations work carried within hence motivation summarise review paper background setting stage to fair many organizations recognise light hand rudder needed order encourage creativity innovation in organisations project management often seen means achieve but well work practice hodgsons paper aims provide insight question via case study organization projectbased form management implemented means balance requirements creativity control in words in response challenges postbureaucratic form project management put forward many triedandtested package techniques able cope discontinuous work expert labour continuous unpredictable change delivering levels reliability control traditional bureaucracy in article i explore contradictions tensions within department hybrid mode control implemented embodying bureaucratic postbureaucratic logics in particular i focus upon discursive tactics employed sell rebureaucratization debureaucratization complex employee responses initiative i argue tensions evident cast significant doubt feasibility seamless integration bureaucracy postbureaucratic organization the discursive tactics hodgson mentions seemingly reasonable rational arguments organization might use sell idea methods approaches project management consistent ideals postbureaucratic organization an example argument goes follows project management routinely used manage new product development projects eminently suited managing creative work incidentally isnt quite right see paper review post bureaucracy vs bureaucracy before moving worth comparing characteristics bureaucratic postbureaucratic organizations hodgson provides following comparison based work charles hekscher bureacracy postbureaucracy consensus acquiescence authority consensus institutionalized dialogue influence based formal position influence persuasionpersonalqualities internal trust immaterial high need internal trust emphasis rules regulations emphasis organizational mission information monopolised top hierarchy strategic information shared organization focus rules conduct focus principles guiding action fixed clear

processes definite impermeable boundaries open permeable boundaries objective rules ensure equity treatment broad public standards performance expectation constancy expectation change the aim case study highlight inconsistencies contradictions result applying bureaucratic mechanism project management manage work group good creative work used freewheeling handsoff management style ie group approximates idealised postbureaucratic environment described why project management project management roots classical management ala taylor fayol perhaps surprising considered means manage work postbureaucratic setting in hodgsons words i argue distinguishes project management particular relevance stcentury organizations rediscovery thcentury preoccupation comprehensive planning linked belief necessity tight managerial discipline project management tools techniques support managerial discipline providing means decompose project manageable bits using wbs say assigning bits individuals small teams the work assigned can tracked controlled tightly good thing if matter rested wouldnt bad often management also prescibes work done this level control results loss autonomy motivation team members whose job work the loss motivation can negative effects especially projects large creative component to counter criticism recent years project management started focus creative aspects projects whats needed motivate teams foster creativity new product development work say etc as hodgson puts the linking project management change management increased project managements influence across industries now largest professional organization project management includes special interest groups areas diverse healthcare retail media marketing hospitality as consequence last decade time particularly rapid expansion project management issues change knowledge management constant innovation emerged central themes popular management discourse so project management offers two seemingly contradictory benefits ability maintain tight control work ability foster innovation creativity  project management can seen essentially bureaucratic system control based principles visibility predictability accountability operationalized adherence formalized procedure constant written reporting mechanisms at time however project management draws upon rhetoric empowerment autonomy selfreliance central  in principle project management offers system attempts integrate bureaucratic control form responsible autonomy keeping interdisciplinary knowledgeintensive nature much project work teams seen light perhaps surprising project management viewed means manage creative work the case study with background done i now move discussion case study in hodgsons words study  focused upon telephone bank northern england i referred pseudonym buzzbank in late s buzzbank set major uk bank i will call tn banking represented one several success stories retail banking sector period through reduced overheads extensive use new technology form sophisticated marketing techniques callcentre technology buzzbank expanded rapidly terms market share turnover developing key component tn bankings global operations my interest particular centred buzzbank senior managements identification project management prime critical success factor organization development project management expertise throughout organization seen key priority maintain performance next decade to extent project teams researched scarcely cutting edge representing highlytrained knowledge workers developing innovative high technology applications solutions new sector enormously profitable industry hodgson conducted interviews observed operations within it department buzzbank period two years during period organization implementing strategic plan aimed formalizing innovation creative work using project management processes the idea words couple senior it managers bring level discipline bring idea professional structuring work highly successful unit the structuring discipline achieved implementing project management processes the main rationale used sell project management buzzbank it team familiar one need ensure predictability repeatability work done whilst ensuring innovation creativity impeded another justification offered management size organization grown considerably years prior implementation strategic plan meant existing adhoc work culture longer successful that size organization necessitated degree formalization ergo bureaucratic procedures put place this rationalised senior management natural inevitable consequence growth  the organization therefore portrayed senior management it approaching next stage evolution the immediate benefit metaphor members senior management charged rebureaucratizing organization carries strong sense inevitability as casts opposition changes irrational futile standing way natural evolution further managers organization dubbed employee resistance natural growing pains like adolescent say cast light dissenting viewpoints portrayed natural unavoidable possibly even necessary ultimately without validity another interesting aspect hodgson highlights way old practices successful bad ones subsumed new formal framework for example old world employees given freedom experiment many considered strength weakness in new world however practice seen threat considered important capture things correctly things became repeatable ala best practice experimentation necessary as one manager put if capture things right least makes things repeatable can record improvement required things dont go right doesnt happen rapidlyexpanding gungho environment hodgson notes terms rapidlyexpanding gungho used negative sense just well cast positive terms flexible proactive etc the point management framed existing situation terms made implementation new procedures seem like logical reasonable next step the processes touted means achieve change ie flexible controlled way so management went great lengths avoid use terms perceived negative example term structure used instead bureaucracy formalization in way management attempted assimilate existing values buzzbank strategic plan so well work heres hodgson says end result the impression given senior management organizational change inevitable gave rise understandable irrational resistance now effectively completed good organization whole on hand impression hodgson got speaking lower level employees different however time spent organization tone target much humour well much stronger reactions appeared throw doubt extent discourse permeated among general employees particularly within it department humour commonplace everyday banter within teams teams it division buzzbank increasing levels bureaucratization butt humour particularly lower levels hierarchy the main experience project management reported many buzzbank employees one intensified bureaucratic surveillance  a key example reaction employees managerial jargon used company circulars literature intended promote strategic plan typically comments provoked circulation literature strategic plan excerpts document read members staff adding ironic comments underline gap document experience life work department hodgson notes employees often appeared comply new regulations way intended management at times employees appeared comply formal requirements new system terms filling necessary forms reporting given times completing necessary worklogs even despite relative sophistication senior managements rearticulation key discourses compliance part buzzbank employees many cases bore hallmarks instrumental behaviour accompanied insubordinate statements humour ranging cynical confrontational at times assurances given senior management immediately contravened fictionalized accounts project activities submitted late else procedures observed meticulously detriment deadlines constraints the emergent organizational order precarious negotiation alienated compliance autonomous disregard bureaucratic demands  in short clear gap perceptions management employees success newly implemented processes it clear buzzbank managers saw project management means control direct creative innovative work way negative effect employee morale motivation the challenge course lay achieving employee buyin management used many creative tactics sell project management staff these included references natural process evolution consequent growing pains organization experience this made pain change natural inevitable necessary interest future gain manipulation terminology make changes seem palatable eg using word structure instead formalization bureaucracy coopting terminology postbureaucratic organizations literature designed promote new structure for example claiming project management processes enable organization even responsive change ie flexible change management processes from employees perspective techniques plainly seen methods sell unsellable the negative reactions employees manifested sarcastic humour often minor acts insubordination the case study thus highlights difficulties using project management means control work postbureaucratic work environment wrappingup reflections summary hodgson sees case study exemplifying problem control vs autonomy emerging postbureaucratic organizations managers view project management means address risks inherent postbureaucratic work whereas employees view unnecessary unjustified imposition management looking best worlds hybrid model incorporated best elements post bureaucratic model traditional command control approach the case study casts doubt whether hybrid possible solely implementation standard project management techniques processes it exposing tensions differences perceptions can occur model implemented so leave managers is way manage creative work without destroying employee morale motivation looking complaints buzzbank employees clear problems arose loss autonomy enjoyed prior implementation new processes this case measure increase autonomy improve situation a couple possibilities come mind i discussed earlier pieces these empower employees make decisions affect work this means allowing freedom decide best approach solving problems within limits specified organisational resource constraints in situations isnt possible one use collaborative techniques dialogue mapping achieve employee buyin of course management prepared engage true dialogue willing act upon reasonable suggestions made employees the key message simple obvious say employees making workrelated decisions engaged motivated theyll this just warm fuzzy notion one backed research motivation see paper review example yes mean letting go reins control extent clear highlighted hodgsons work holding reins tightly might cause problems solves whats called degree flexibility use project management processes means open employee input whats working well whats to sum hodgsons case study suggests inflexible project management based approaches managing creative work may work well advertised purveyors frameworks methodologies as alternative might worth taking step towards utopian ideal postbureaucratic organisation using techniques encourage employee input organisational decision making
