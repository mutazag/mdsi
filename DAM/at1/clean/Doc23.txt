the story sociotechnical systems began little half century ago somewhat unlikely setting coalfields yorkshire the british coal industry just nationalised new mechanised mining methods introduced mines it thought nationalisation sort chronic labourmanagement issues mechanisation address issue falling productivity but things werent going planned in words eric trist one founders tavistock institute   newly nationalized industry well productivity failed increase step increases mechanization men leaving mines large numbers attractive opportunities factory world among remained absenteeism averaged labour disputes frequent despite improved conditions employment excerpted the evolution sociotechnical systems conceptual framework action research program e trist trist colleagues asked national coal board come help to end comparative study two mines similar except one high productivity morale whereas suffered low performance major labour issues their job far easy welcome coalface workers associated management board trist recounts around time study started number postgraduate fellows tavistock institute one ken bamforth knew coal industry well miner postgraduate fellows worked mines encouraged visit old workplaces year write impressions focusing things changed since worked after one visit bamforth reported back news workplace innovation occurred newly opened seam haighmoor among things morale productivity particular seam high compared similar ones the teams way working entirely novel world away hierarchically organised set standard mechanised mines time in trists words the work organization new seam us novel phenomenon consisting set relatively autonomous groups interchanging roles shifts regulating affairs minimum supervision cooperation task groups everywhere evidence personal commitment obvious absenteeism low accidents infrequent productivity high the contrast large atmosphere arrangements faces conventional areas pit negative features characteristic industry glaringly apparent excerpted paper referenced to appreciate radical nature practices seam one needs understand backdrop occurred to end helpful compare mechanised work practices introduced postwar years older ones premechanised era mining in days mines mechanised miners typically organise workgroups six miners cover three work shifts teams two each miner able pretty much job seam pick workmates previous shift left this necessary order ensure continuity work shifts the group negotiated price mined coal directly management amount received shared equally amongst members group this mode working required strong cooperation trust within group course however workgroups reorganised time time due attrition reasons individual miners understood importance maintaining individual reputations reliable trustworthy workmates it important get good workgroup groups likely get productive seams work seams assigned bargaining typically job senior miner group there considerable competition best seams generally kept within bounds civility via informal rules rituals this traditional way working survive mechanisation for one mechanised mines encouraged specialisation organised like assembly lines clearly defined job roles different responsibilities pay scales moreover workers shift perform part extraction process leaving subsequent shifts continue work left as miners paid job rather amount coal produced single group endtoend responsibility product delays due unexpected events tended get compounded one felt need make time as result often happen work planned shift completed this meant next shift well composed group completely different skills start work see job finish work earlier shift unsurprisingly blame shifting scapegoating rife from supervisors point view difficult maintain level oversight control underground mining work possible assembly line the environment underground simply conducive close supervision also uncertain prone unexpected events bureaucratic organisational structures completely unsuited dealing decisionmakers far removed coalface literally this perhaps important insight come tavistock coal mining studies as claudio ciborra puts classic book teams since production process seam much prone disorganisation due uncertainty complexity underground conditions bureaucratic allocation jobs easily disrupted coping emergencies coping coping became part workers supervisors everyday activities these activities lead stress conflict low productivity continually clashed technological arrangements way planned subdivided around thus see new assemblyline bureaucracy inspired work organisation totally unsuited work environment endtoend responsibility decision making far removed action in contrast traditional workgroup six able deal uncertainties complexities underground work team members strong sense responsibility performance team whole moreover teams uniquely placed deal unexpected events actually living occurred therefore decide best way deal what bamforth found haighmoor seam possible recapture spirit old ways working adapting larger specialised groups necessary mechanised mines as ciborra describes book the new form work organisation features forty one men allocate tasks shifts although tasks shifts conventional mechanised system management supervisors monitor enforce reward single task executions the composite group takes managerial tasks premechanised marrow group selection group members informal monitoring workcycle completion task execution becomes common goal allows mutual learning supportthere basic wage bonus linked overall productivity group throughout whole cycle rather shift the competition shifts plagued conventional mechanised method effectively eliminated  bamforth trists studies haighmoor convinced viable better alternatives typical mid late th century work places their work led insight best work arrangements come seeking match technical social elements modern day workplace thus born notion sociotechnical systems ever since assemblyline management philosophies taylor ford increasing trend towards division labour bureaucratisation mechanisation automation work processes despite early work tavistock school others followed trend continues dominate management practice arguably even recent years the haighmoor innovation described one earliest demonstrations better way this message since echoed many academics thinkers remains largely underappreciated ignored professional managers little idea completely forgotten like work coalface
