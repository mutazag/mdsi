much can learnt organization observing management things go wrong one reaction hunt scapegoat someone can held responsible mess the take systemic view focuses finding root cause issue figuring can done order prevent recurring in highly cited paper published james reason compared contrasted two approaches error management organisations this post extensive summary paper the author gets point first paragraph the human error problem can viewed two ways person approach system approach each model error causation model gives rise quite different philosophies error management understanding differences important practical implications coping ever present risk mishaps clinical practice reasons paper published british medical journal hence focus practice medicine his arguments conclusions however much wider relevance evidenced diverse areas paper cited the person approach i think accurately called scapegoat approach based belief errors can traced back individual group party responsible held account error this approach taken organisations colloquially referred blame culture to extent looking around scapegoat natural emotional reaction error the oft unstated reason behind scapegoating however avoid management responsibility as author tells us people viewed free agents capable choosing safe unsafe modes behaviour if something goes wrong seems obvious individual group individuals must responsible seeking far possible uncouple persons unsafe acts institutional responsibility clearly interests managers it also legally convenient  however scapegoat approach couple serious problems hinder effective risk management firstly organization depends frontline staff report problems lapses clearly staff will feel safe something simply possible organization takes scapegoat approach the author suggests chernobyl disaster can attributed lack reporting culture within erstwhile soviet union secondly perhaps important focus scapegoat leaves underlying cause error unaddressed as author puts focusing individual origins error scapegoat approach isolates unsafe acts system context as consequence scapegoat approach overlooks systemic features errors example empirical fact kinds errors tend recur within given system the system approach accepts human errors will happen however contrast scapegoat approach views errors triggered factors built system so something goes wrong system approach focuses procedures used rather people executing this difference scapegoat approach makes world difference the system approach looks generic reasons errors accidents occur organisations usually series measures place prevent errors eg alarms procedures checklists trained staff etc each measures can looked upon defensive layer error however author notes defensive layer holes can let errors pass holes arise bit later a good way visualize series slices swiss cheese see figure figure the swiss cheese model httppatientsafetyedduhsdukeedumoduleeswisscheesehtml figure the swiss cheese model httppatientsafetyedduhsdukeedumoduleeswisscheesehtml the important point holes given slice fixed position keep opening closing even shifting around depending state organization an error occurs ephemeral holes different layers temporarily line let error there two reasons holes arise defensive layers active errors these unsafe acts committed individuals active errors violations set procedures momentary lapses the scapegoat approach focuses identifying active error person responsible however author points active errors almost always caused conditions built system brings us   latent conditions these flaws built system the author uses term resident pathogens describe nice metaphor i explored paper review i wrote years ago these pathogens usually baked system poor design decisions flawed procedures one hand illthoughtout management decisions manifestations former include faulty alarms unrealistic inconsistent procedures poorly designed equipment manifestations latter include things unrealistic targets overworked staff lack funding appropriate equipment the important thing note latent conditions can lie dormant long period noticed typically latent condition comes light error caused occurs  organization root cause analysis error something simply done organization takes scapegoat approach the author draws nice analogy clarifies link active errors latent conditions  active failures like mosquitoes they can swatted one one still keep coming the best remedies create effective defences drain swamps breed the swamps case ever present latent conditions draining swamp simple task the author draws upon studies high performance organisations combat units nuclear power plants air traffic control centres understand minimised active errors reducing system flaws he notes organisations accept errors will occur despite standardised procedures train staff deal learn practice responses known error scenarios try imagine new ones regular basis delegate responsibility authority especially crisis situations do root cause analysis error occurs address underlying problem changing system needed in contrast organisation takes scapegoat approach assumes standardisation will eliminate errors ignores possibility novel errors occurring centralises control focuses finding scapegoats instead fixing system
