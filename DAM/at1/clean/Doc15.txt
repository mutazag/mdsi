heres question thats mind why organisations find difficult capture transmit knowledge created projects ill attempt answer sorts post point solution sorts taking bit detour along way im often guilty   let us first consider knowledge generated projects in project environments knowledge typically created response challenge faced the challenge may project objective case knowledge created embedded product service design on hand small part project say limitation technology used case knowledge might correspond workaround discovered project team member in either case existence issue challenge precondition creation knowledge the project team subset decides issue tackled they incrementally exploration trial error discussion creating knowledge bargain in nutshell knowledge created project members go process discovery this process may involve entire team first example small subset thereof second example programmer may working alone in cases though aim understand problem explore potential solutions find best one thus creating new knowledge now perspective project organisational learning project documentation must capture solution process developed typically documentation tends focus former neglecting latter this akin presenting solution high school mathematics problem without showing intervening steps my high school maths teacher wouldve awarded zero effort regardless whether answer right and good reason steps leading solution important solution why because steps illustrate thought processes reasoning behind solution so project documentation ideally documentation provide background constraints viewpoints arguments counterarguments go creation project knowledge unfortunately seldom why an answer can found farsighted paper entitled designing organizational memory preserving intellectual assets knowledge economy published jeff conklin in paper conklin draws distinction formal informal knowledge terms correspond endresult process discussed previous paragraphto quote paper formal knowledge  stuff books manuals documents training courses  primary work product knowledge worker  conklin notes organisations routinely capture formal knowledge indeed rely without much success organizational memory on hand informal knowledge knowledge created used process creating formal resultsit includes ideas facts assumptions meanings questions decisions guesses stories points view it important work knowledge worker formal knowledge ephemeral transitory  as consequence informal knowledge elusive rarely makes documents dr conklin lists two reasons organisations includes temporary organisations projects fail capture informal knowledge these business culture values results process in words one reason widespread failure capture informal knowledge western culture come value results output work process far process emphasise things relationships the tools knowledge workers support process knowledge work tools focus capturing formal knowledge end result knowledge work rather informal knowledge end result achieved steps solution speak the key creating useful documentation thus lies capturing informal knowledge in order elusive form knowledge must first made explicit ie expressible words pictures heres notion shared understanding discussed previous post comes play to quote conklins paper one element creating shared understanding making informal knowledge explicit this means surfacing key ideas facts assumptions meanings questions decisions guesses stories points view it means capturing organizing informal knowledge everyone access it means changing process knowledge work focus creating managing shared display groups informal thinking learning the shared display transparent vehicle making informal knowledge explicit the notion shared display central technique dialogue mapping group facilitation technique can help diverse group achieve shared understanding problem dialogue mapping uses visual notation called ibis short issue based information system capture issues ideas arguments come meeting see previous post quick introduction dialogue mapping crashcourse ibis as far knowledge capture concerned i see two distinct uses ibis they as conklin suggests ibis maps can used surface capture informal knowledge realtime generated discussion two people it can also used situations one person researches finds solution challenge in case person use ibis capture background approaches tried pros cons ie process solution arrived this together formal stuff project organisations capture adequately result documents provide complete view knowledge generated projects now previous post linked i discussed example dialogue mapping used reallife project challenge best implement near realtime updates finance data mart the final issue map constructed using mapping tool called compendium reproduced final map example issue map the map captures decisions made also options discussed arguments options as captures decision along context process rationale behind in words captures formal informal knowledge pertaining decision in simple case ibis succeeded making informal knowledge explicit project teams line can understand decision made technical business perspective it worth noting compendium maps can reference external documents via reference nodes though less important argumentation extremely useful documentation here illustration references external documents can inserted ibis map reference node links external docs links external docs as illustrated feature can used link range external documents clicking reference node map image opens external document exploiting project document can operate two levels first ibis map depicts relationships issues ideas arguments second supporting documents provide details specific nodes relationships much informal knowledge pertaining issue resides first level ie relationships nodes knowledge made explicit map to conclude perhaps worth summarising main points post projects generate new knowledge process issues ideas proposed explored trialled typically project documentation captures outcome formal knowledge neglecting much context background process discovery informal knowledge ibis maps offer possibility capturing aspects knowledge resulting greatly improved project hence organisational memory
