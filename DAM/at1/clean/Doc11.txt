issue based information system ibis notation invented horst rittel werner kunz early s ibis best known use dialogue mapping collaborative approach tackling wicked problems ie contentious issues organisations it range applications well capturing knowledge good example ill much say later post over last five years i written fair bit ibis blog book i coauthored dialogue mapping expert paul culmsee the present post reprises article i wrote five years ago whence notation practical aspects notation grammar etc well origins advantages limitations my motivations revisiting piece revise update original discussion important cover recent developments ibis technology open interesting possibilities area knowledge management to appreciate power ibis best begin understanding context notation invented ill therefore start discussion origins notation followed introduction finally ill cover development last odd years focusing recent developments i mentioned wicked origins a good place start started ibis first described paper entitled issues elements information systems written horst rittel man coined term wicked problem werner kunz july they state intent behind ibis first line abstract paper issuebased information systems ibis meant support coordination planning political decision processes ibis guides identification structuring settling issues raised problemsolving groups provides information pertinent discourse rittels preoccupation area public policy planning also context defined term wicked problem originally given background surprise rittel kunz foresaw ibis  type information system meant support work cooperatives like governmental administrative agencies committees planning groups etc confronted problem complex order arrive plan decision  the problems tackled cooperatives paradigmdefining examples wicked problems from start ibis intended tool facilitate collaborative approach solving  better managing wicked problem helping develop shared perspective a brief introduction ibis the ibis notation consists following three elements issuesor questions issues debated typically issues framed questions lines what x x issue interest group for example case group executives x might rapidly changing market condition whereas case group it people x ageing system hard replace ideasor positions responses questions for example one ideas offered it group might replace said system newer one typically whole set ideas respond issue discussion represents spectrum participant perspectives issue arguments can pros arguments cons arguments issue the complete set arguments respond idea represents multiplicity viewpoints compendium freeware tool can used create ibis maps can downloaded in compendium ibis elements described represented nodes shown figure issues represented bluegreen question marks positions yellow light bulbs pros green signs cons red signs compendium supports node types part core ibis notation nodes can linked ways specified ibis grammar i discuss next figure ibis elements figure ibis elements the ibis grammar can summarized three simple rules issues can raised anew can arise issues positions arguments in words ibis element can questioned in compendium notation question node can connect ibis node ideas can respond questions ie compendium light bulb nodes can link question nodes the arrow pointing idea question depicts responds relationship arguments can associated ideas ie compendium nodes can link light bulb nodes arrows pointing latter the legal links summarized figure figure legal links ibis figure legal links ibis yes simple the rules best illustrated example follow links see illustrations ibis action see postfor simple example dialogue mapping see postor one examples argument visualisation note using ibis map structure written arguments called issue mapping see one example paul children this example also features book made appearance book now know ibis works seen examples action time trace history notation early days present operation early systems when rittel kunz wrote paper three ibistype systems operation two government agencies us one presumes one university environment quite possibly berkeley rittel worked although seems quaint oldfashioned now surprise manual paperbased systems effort expense involved computerizing systems early s prohibitive payoff questionable the rittelkunz paper introduced earlier also offers short description early ibis systems operated an initially unstructured problem area topic denotes task named trigger phrase urban renewal baltimore the war tax reform about topic subtopics discourse develops issues brought disputed different positions rittels word ideas responses assumed arguments constructed defense different positions issue settled convincing opponents decided formal decision procedure frequently questions fact directed experts fed documentation system answers obtained can questioned turned issues through counterplay questioning arguing participants form exert judgments incessantly developing structured pictures problem solutions it possible separate understanding problem phase information solution since every formulation problem also statement potential solution even today forty years later excellent description ibis used facilitate common understanding complex problems moreover process reaching shared understanding whether using ibis one key ways knowledge created within organizations to foreshadow point i will elaborate later using ibis capture key issues ideas arguments connections results navigable map knowledge generated discussion fast forward couple decades in paper published entitled gibis a hypertext tool exploratory policy discussion conklin begeman describe prototype graphical hypertextbased ibistype system called gibis use capturing design rationale yes despite title paper capturing design rationale policy discussions the development gibis represents key step original rittelkunz version ibis recent version implemented compendium amongst things ibis finally paper disk opening world new possibilities gibis aimed offer users the ability capture design rationale options discussed including ones rejected discussion around pros cons a platform promoting computermediated collaborativedesign work ideally situations participants located sites remote the ability store large amount information able navigate intuitive way the gibis prototype proved successful enough catalyse development questmap commercially available software tool supported ibis in recent conversation jeff conklin mentioned questmap one earliest windowsbased groupware tools available market  won bestofshow award category it interesting note contrast questmap longer exists compendium singleuser desktop software the primary application questmap area sensemaking helping groups reach collective understanding complex situations might otherwise lead tense adversarial conditions indeed precisely rittel kunz intended ibis used the key advantage offered computerized ibis systems one map dialogues realtime map representing points raised conversation along logical connections this proved big step forward use ibis help groups achieve shared understanding complex issues that said although notable early successes realtime use ibis industry environments see paper example accompanied widespread adoption technique it worth exploring reasons briefly the tacitness ibis mastery the reasons lack traction ibistype techniques realtime knowledge capture discussed paper shum et al entitled hypermedia support argumentationbased rationale years gibis qoc the reasons give for acceptance system must offer immediate value person using quoting paper no designer can expected altruistically enter quality design rationale solely possible benefit possibly unknown person unknown point future unknown task there must immediate value such immediate value obvious novice users ibistype systems there effort involved gaining fluency use ibisbased software tools it users can gain appreciation value tools overcoming limitations mapping design arguments paper whiteboards etc while rules ibis simple grasp intellectual effort cognitive overhead using ibis real time involves teasing issues ideas arguments dialogue classifying points raised issues ideas arguments naming describing point succinctly relating linking point existing map anticipating will fit later developing sense conversational patterns expertise skills can developed sustained practice surprise beginners find hard use ibis map dialogues indeed use ibis realtime conversation mapping tacit skill much like riding bike swimming can mastered making sense ibis despite difficulties mastering ibis easy see offers considerable advantages conventional methods documenting discussions indeed rittel kunz well aware their paper contains nice summary advantages i paraphrase ibis can bridge gap discussions records discussions minutes audiovideo transcriptions etc ibis sits two acting shortterm memory the paper thus foreshadows use issuebased systems aid organizational project memory many elements issues ideas arguments come discussion contextual meanings different preexisting definitions that interpretation points made questions raised depends circumstances surrounding discussion what important contextual meaning important formal meaning ibis captures former clear way example response question what mean x elicits meaning x context discussion subsequently captured idea position ill much say towards end article the reasoning used discussions made transparent supporting opposing evidence the state argument discussion time can inferred glance unlike case written records see post advantages visual documentation prose often times happens commonality issues similar issues might important precise meaning to quote paper   description subject matter terms librarians documentalists sic may less significant similarity issue issues dealt previously information used treatment  this less issue now search technologies however search technologies still largely based keywords rather context a properly structured contextsearchable ibisbased archive useful conventional documentbased system as ill discuss next section technology now available to sum although ibis offers means map arguments lacking ability make maps available searchable across organization ibis enterprise it interesting note compendium unlike predecessor questmap singleuser desktop tool enable sharing maps across enterprise to sure possible work around limitation workarounds somewhat clunky a recent advance ibis technology addresses issue rather elegantly seven sigma australian consultancy founded paul culmsee chris tomich peter chow developed glyma pronounced glimmer product makes ibis available collaboration platforms like microsoft sharepoint this gamechanger enables sharing searching ibis maps across enterprise moreover shall see implications go beyond sharing search full disclosure as regular readers blog know paul good friend jointly written book papers however time writing i commercial association seven sigma my comments based playing beta version product paul kind enough give access well discussions i figure ibis glyma figure ibis glyma click see larger picture the look feel glyma much compendium see fig keystrokes shortcuts quite similar i trialled glyma weeks feel overall experience actually bit better compendium for example one can navigate series maps submaps using breadcrumb trail another example documents videos embedded within map one need leave map order view tagged media unless course one wants see higher resolution i wont go detail product features etc since kind information best accessed source ie product website documentation instead i will now focus glyma addresses longstanding gap knowledge management systems revisiting problem context in organisations knowledge artefacts documents audiovisual media stored hierarchical relational structures example folder within directory structure relational database to sure stored artefacts often tagged metadata indicating created experience tells metadata useful the problem context artefact created typically captured anyone read document wondered what earth authors thinking wrote encountered problem missing context context though hard capture critically important understanding content knowledge artefact any artefact accessed without appreciation context created liable misinterpreted partially understood capturing context enterprise glyma addresses issue context rather elegantly level enterprise ill illustrate point inspiring case study innovative use sharepoint education paul written time ago the case study here backstory pauls words earlier year i met louis zulli jnr teacher florida part program called centre advanced technologies we cokeynoting conference came i droned common sharepoint governance mistakesthe majority lous presentation showcased whole bunch sharepoint powered solutions students written the solutions impressivewe treated examples like ios android windows phone apps leveraged sharepoint display teachers assignments school events class times silverlight based application providing virtual tour campus integration sharepoint moodle open source learning platform an academic planner web application allowing students plan classes submit schedule reviewed track credits classes selected whether students selections meet graduation requirements all developed year olds level quality i know sharepoint consultancies jealous   although examples highlighted louis impressive paul found interesting anecdotes lou related dedication persistence students displayed work quoting paul so demos impressive enough actually impressed in fact hooked slide deck it anecdotes lou told dedication students task went getting things done he spoke students working various school breaks get projects completed leveraged others various skills strengths lous final slide summed talk brilliantly students want make difference give right project incredible things make project meaningful let serve purpose campus community learn listen if students better way if idea let explore invest success early make sure infrastructure guarantee uptime development farm every situation different harm failure i failed ive found ways wont work thomas a edison in brief points highlight fact lous primary role director center create conditions make possible students great work the commerciallevel quality work turned students suggests lous knowledge build highperforming teams definitely worth capturing the question whats best way short getting visit talk experiences seeing forest trees paul recently interviewed lou intent documenting lous experiences the conversation recorded video glymafied ie video mapped using ibis see figure figure knowledge capture via glyma figure knowledge capture via glyma click see larger picture there points worth noting the content entire conversation mapped one can see conversation glance the context particular point ie content node made clarified connections node neighbours moving left node gives higher level picture moving right drills details of course reader will noted core ibis capabilities available compendium ibis tool glyma offers much consider following relevant documents audio visual media can tagged specific nodes provide supplementary material in case video recording tagged specific nodes related points made video clicking play icon attached node plays segment content node discussed this really nice feature saves user watch whole video play extended game ffwdrew get point interest moreover provides additional context captured map for example one can attach papers links web pages slideshare presentations etc fill background context glyma integrated enterprise content management system design one can therefore link map video content powerful builtin search content aggregation features systems for example users able enter search intranet home page retrieve traditional content documents also stories reflections anecdotes experts lou another critical aspect intranet integration ability provide maps contextual navigation amazons ability sell books people never intended buy example power navigation the ability execute kinds queries outlined previous point along contextual information user profile details previous activity intranet area intranet user browsing makes possible present recommendations nodes maps may potential interest users such targeted recommendations might encourage users explore video rich media content technical aside an interesting underthehood feature glyma uses implementation hypergraph database store maps note database can store representations graphs maps edge can connect vertices these databases enable storing general graph structures what means glyma can extended store kind map mind maps concept maps argument maps whatever  nodes can shared across maps this feature developed yet i mention offers exciting possibilities future to summarise since glyma stores data enterpriseclass database maps can made available across organization it offers ability tag nodes pretty much kind media documents audiovideo clips etc one can tag specific parts media relevant content node snippet video example moreover sophisticated search capabilities platform enable context aware search specifically can search nodes keywords tags node interest located can also view maps appears the maps inform us contexts relating node the ability display contextual environment piece information makes glyma really interesting in metaphorical terms glyma enables us see forest trees   conclude my aim post introduce readers ibis notation trace history origins issue mapping recent developments knowledge management the history technique valuable gives insight rationale behind creation leads better understanding different ways can used indeed exaggeration say knowledge management applications discussed extension rittels original reasons inventing ibis i like close piece couple observations experience ibis firstly real surprise technique can capture written arguments conversations despite three distinct elements simple grammar yes require thought particularly mapping discussions real time however cognitive overhead good forces mapper think whats said instead just writing blind thoughtful transcription aim game when done right results map truly reflects understanding complex issue secondly although current discussions ibis focus applications dialogue mapping important role play mapping organizational knowledge maps offer powerful means navigate complex network knowledge within organisation the aspirational endgoal effort global knowledge map highlights interconnections different kinds knowledge exists within organization to sure map will make little sense human eye powerful search capabilities make navigable to extent feasible direction i foresee ibis becoming important skill repertoire knowledge management professionals
