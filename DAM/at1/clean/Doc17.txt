the aim opinion piece writer convince readers particular idea point view reasonable right typically pieces weave facts interpretations reasoning prose wherefrom can hard pick essential thread argumentation in earlier post i showed issue map can help clarifying central arguments difficult piece writing mapping fred brooks classic article no silver bullet note i use word difficult article times misunderstood misquoted particularly hard follow still brooks article borders academic arguments presented therein interest relatively small group people within software development community most developers architects arent terribly interested essential difficulties profession just want get jobs in present post i develop issue map piece potentially wider interest it community nicholas carrs article it doesnt matter the main point carrs article it becoming utility much like electricity water rail as trend towards commoditisation gains momentum strategic advantage offered inhouse it will diminish organisations will better served buying it services computing utility providers maintaining it shops although carr makes persuasive case glosses key difference it utilities see post despite many business it leaders taken words way things will it therefore important it professionals understand carrs arguments the consequences likely affect time soon havent already some preliminaries proceeding map first complete article available may want read proceeding isnt essential second discussion assumes basic knowledge ibis issuebased information system see post quick tutorial ibis third map constructed using opensource tool compendium can downloaded with preliminaries way lets get issue mapping carrs article so whats root ie central question carr poses article the title piece it doesnt matter one possible root question why doesnt it matter but candidates on basis it infrastructural technology why strategic value it diminishing example from clear theres fair degree subjectivity every step constructing issue map the visual representation i construct one interpretation carrs argument out many possibles i choose why doesnt it matter root question why well view whole point piece convince reader it doesnt matter infrastructural technology consequently strategic significance this point become clearer development issue map progresses the ideas respond question arent immediately obvious this isnt unusual ive mentioned elsewhere points can made sequentially one expressed prose in cases one may read piece entirety figure elements respond root question in case hand response root question stands clearly quick browse article it it infrastructural technology the map root question response shown figure figure issue map stage figure issue map stage moving arguments carr offer pros cons idea a reading article reveals one con four pros lets look cons first it i take mean software complex malleable unlike infrastructural technologies this point mentioned passing third page paper although complex malleable predecessors it hallmarks infrastructural technology  the arguments supporting idea it infrastructural technology the evolution it closely mirrors infrastructural technologies electricity rail although point encompasses points made i think merits separate mention analogies quite striking carr makes persuasive wellresearched case supporting point it highly replicable this point needs elaboration i think it transport mechanism digital information this true least far network messaging infrastructure concerned cost effectiveness increases it services shared this true providing understood flexibility lost services shared the map incorporating pros cons shown figure figure issue map stage figure issue map stage now arguments notion it infrastructural technology laid lets look article time eye issues questions raised the first question obvious one what consequences it infrastructural technology another point considered role proprietary technologies definition arent infrastructural the holds true custom built applications so begs question it infrastructural technology proprietary custom built applications fit the map questions added shown figure figure issue map stage figure issue map stage lets now look ideas respond two questions a point carr makes early article strategic value it diminishing this essentially consequence notion it infrastructural technology this idea supported following arguments it ubiquitous everywhere least business world everyone uses way this implies one gets strategic advantage using what proprietary technologies custom apps carr reckons doomed economic obsolescence this idea supported argument apps expensive hard maintain related will replaced generic apps incorporate best practices this trend already evident increasing number enterprise type applications offered services the advantages cost little b can offered web c spare client painful maintenance headaches the map incorporating ideas supporting arguments shown figure figure issue map stage figure issue map stage finally painting somewhat gloomy picture corporate it minion carr asks answers question how organisations deal changing role it strategic operational his answers reduce it spend buy proven technology follow dont lead focus operational vulnerabilities rather strategic opportunities the map incorporating question ideas respond shown figure also final map click graphic view fullsized image figure final issue map figure issue map stage map completed im essentially done post before closing however id like mention couple general points arise issue mapping prose pieces figure interpretation article i emphasise interpretation may coincide carr intended convey fact probably doesnt this highlights important obvious point writer intends convey writing may coincide readers interpret even worse different readers may interpret piece differently writers need write awareness potential misunderstood so first point issue maps can help writers clarify improve quality reasoning cast prose issue maps sketch logical skeleton framework argumentative prose as can help highlight weak points arguments for example article carr glosses complexity malleability software this weak point argument key difference it traditional infrastructural technologies thus second point issue maps can help readers visualise weak links arguments might obscured rhetoric persuasive writing to conclude issue maps valuable writers readers writers can use issue maps improve quality arguments committing writing readers can use maps understand arguments thus committed
