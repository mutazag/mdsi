risks using rational methods broad enough account wicked aspects risk i thinking i stumbled fascinating paper robin holt entitled risk management the talking cure outlines possible approach analysing interconnected risks in brief holt draws parallel psychoanalysis means tackle individual anxiety risk management means tackle organizational anxiety in post i present extensive discussion interpretation holt s paper although philosophy risk management practice i found paper interesting relevant thought provoking my hope readers might find background holt begins noting modern life characterized uncertainty paradoxically technological progress increased sense control surroundings lives actually heightened personal feelings uncertainty moreover sense uncertainty allayed rational analysis on contrary may even increased example drawing attention risks may otherwise remained unaware risk thus becomes lens perceive world the danger can paralyze as holt puts  risk becomes backdrop perceiving world perception collapses selfinhibition thereby compounding uncertainty inertia most individuals know experience us one time another frozen inaction perceived risks we also know deep personal level standard responses risk inadequate many worries tend inchoate therefore can neither coherently articulated analysed in holt s words people recognize risk perspective breakdown rational calculations alone threats forms life noncalculative way see world mainstream risk analysis remains caught thrall expert presumptions denigrating lay knowledge perceptions grounds codified institutionally expressed holt suggests risk management account codified uncodified uncodifiable aspects uncertainty organizational perspective this entails mode analysis takes account different even conflicting perspectives nonjudgemental way in essence suggests talking means increase awareness contingent nature risks rather means definitively resolving shortcomings risk analysis the basic aim risk analysis practiced contain uncertainty within set bounds determined organisation s risk appetite as mentioned earlier process begins identifying classifying risks once done one determines probability impact risk then based priorities resources available determined organisation s risk appetite one develops strategies mitigate risks significant organisation s perspective however messiness organizational life makes difficult see risk clearcut way we may pretend rational reality perceive lens background interests experiences based perceptions rationalize action inaction simply get life as holt writes the concept risk refers   mélange experience managers accept contingencies without overwhelmed point complete passivity confusion managers learn recognize differences things

often futile exercise although one may well argue case many organizational risks undeniable certain mitigation strategies example accepting risks turn significant later may significant consequences

judgemental analysis limited vicissitudes budgets programmes personalities contested priorities in short risk management practice tends far way portrayed textbooks professional literature the wickedness risk management most managers work supervision schooled rationalscientific approach problem solving it surprise therefore use manage risks gather analyse information potential risks formulate potential solutions mitigation strategies implement best one according predetermined criteria however method works problems straightforward tame rather wicked many issues risk managers confronted wicked messy often though problems treated tame reducing wicked messy problem one amenable rational analysis invariably entails overlooking views certain stakeholder groups worse ignoring key aspects problem this may work short term will exacerbate problem longer run holt illustrates point follows a primary danger mistaking mess tame problem becomes even difficult deal mess blaming operator error mishap production line introducing added surveillance illustration mess mistaken tame problem an operator easily isolated identifiable whereas technological system process embedded unwieldy initially far costly alter blaming operators politically expedient it might also managers administrators know think terms messes learned sort complex sociotechnical systems it important note although many risk management practitioners recognize essential wickedness issues deal practice risk management quite task dealing matters one step towards develop shared enterprisewide understanding

given risk wildly different ways much consensus can reached the problem current framework risk management requires analyst perform objective analysis situationproblem even situations possible to get around holt suggests may useful see risk management way encounter problems rather analyse solve what mean he sees forum people can talk risks openly to enable organizational members encounter problems risk management s repertoire activity needs engage human components belief perception enthusiasm fear this gets root problem risk matters increases anxiety generally affects peoples sense wellbeing given surprise holt s proposed solution draws psychoanalysis the analogy psychoanalysis risk management any discussion psychoanalysis especially one intended audience largely schooled rationalscientific methods analysis must begin acknowledgement claims psychoanalysis tested that since psychoanalysis speaks unobservable objects ego unconscious claims makes concepts proven falsified however holt suggests exactly makes good fit encountering opposed analyzing risks in words it precisely psychoanalysis avoids overarching claim produce testable watertight universal theories relevance risk management by avoiding universal theories formulas risk management can afford deviate pronouncements using mathematical formulas cover immanent indeterminables manifest human perception awareness systems integration his point clear parallel psychoanalysis individual risk management organisation we understand according template according peculiar beguiling histories metaphorically risk

encountering messes wicked problems wicked messes can forced think in brief holt suggests psychoanalysis individual risk management organisation talking importance conversations a key element psychoanalysis conversation analyst patient through process analyst attempts get patient become aware hidden fears motivations as holt puts psychoanalysis occupies point rupture conscious intention unconscious desire — revealing repressed overdetermined aspects selforganization manifest various expressions anxiety humour and little later makes connection organisations the fact organizations

using technical assessment tools using conversations devoid fixed formulas encounter questioned identities indeterminate destinies multiple conflicting aims myriad anxieties through conversations

mainstream risk management addresses riskrelated anxieties fears individuals affected conclusion this brings end notsoshort summary holt s paper given length post i reckon i keep closing remarks short so i ll leave paraphrasing last line paper summarises main message risk management developing organizational capacity overcoming risks freed presumption absolute control
