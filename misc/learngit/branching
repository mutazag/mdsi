1) create a new branch 

  git branch learngit
  
  
2) switch to the new branch 

  git checkout learngit
  
  
notes: 

* you can use the command: "git checkout -b learngit" to combine the above two steps

* to switch back to master

  git checkout master
  
* to list branches 

  git branch 
  
  
at this stage github (remote) knows nothing about the new branch. look at gitk to see where does the new branch 
sit in relation to local master and remote master

3) push my branch to upstream, notice the use of --set-upstream
  
  git push --set-upstream origin learngit 



notes: 

* can make more changes to files in the local branch and keep pushing to upstream

* gitk will show that local branch is advancing independently from master

* can now switch between branches to make edits, local files in one branch will not be visibile in other branches if are not synced with remote then locally to the new branch or branches were merged 


4) if i want to merge master back into the new branch i will have to first commit all local changes in the branch (or stash them -- about that later), then do a git merge command 

  git checkout learngit
  git merge master 
  
notes: 

* checkout to the local branch to be updated
* merge refering to the other branch that need to be merged into the sleected branch, in this case, master is merged into learngit
* note how gitk now shows the branch and then the merge with the master 
* files that where added independently in master are now also visible in the branch (when checkout to branch is performed) 





5) go online on git hub to create a pull request, review and merge 

notes:
* next time you pull a master it will have the new changes from branch
* always remember to update the branch with changes from master before starting new code updates
* once pull requet is approved and branch is not reqired anymore to track local changes, it can be deleted 

6) delete a local branch 

  git branch -d learngit
  
notes: 
* start over again for new branches


<<<<<<< HEAD
7) list and delete remote branch 

  git branch -r 
  git branch -r origin/learngit -d
