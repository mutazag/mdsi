1) create a new branch 

  git branch learngit
  
  
2) switch to the new branch 

  git checkout learngit
  
  
notes: 

* you can use the command: "git checkout -b learngit" to combine the above two steps

* to switch back to master

  git checkout master
  
* to list branches 

  git branch 
  
  
at this stage github (remote) knows nothing about the new branch. look at gitk to see where does the new branch 
sit in relation to local master and remote master

3) push my branch to upstream, notice the use of --set-upstream
  
  git push --set-upstream origin learngit
